february 01 - february 27, 2014 \"this exhibition grew out of an assignment i came up with for students in my art & digital technology classes. its source is one of my own photographic endeavors; every day . every day is a project in which, starting on february 23, 1987, i began taking one more or less identically posed and lighted photograph of my face every day. i have maintained this practice up to and through the present, and plan to continue each day for the remainder of my life. more about every day may be found at http://kbeveryday.blogspot.com about 10 years ago, i began to give my art & digital technology classes a new assignment; i\u2019d send each student a digital photo of my face, from the every day project, for them to play with in adobe photoshop, to transform as they saw fit. my intention was to give them something of mine, and have them apply their creative resources and budding photoshop skills to make it their own. by 2008, i had been working on my own project long enough to be able to individualize the image i'd send to each student; i could now give some, then many, then all of them the photo i'd taken of my face on the day they were born. this new aspect added a more specific collaborative aspect to the assignment, a condition i suggested that they try to bring to their finished piece. the question posed was, 'how can you alter this image so that it visually and conceptually has something to do with the day you were born? something about your family, perhaps, or the place where you lived. what happened in the world on that date?' \" -

monster into a figure of beauty. she wrote, \u201cyou only have to look at the medusa straight on to see her. and she\u2019s not deadly, she\u2019s beautiful and she\u2019s laughing\u201d. the

university archives makes every effort to make materials available to researchers, it should be noted that many records and collections are closed to users outside the originating office. selected resources in the burns library: governance and committee records. administrative office records. most of the records in the university archives fall into the category of administrative records. these include records of boston college organizations, departments, and offices. executive offices like the president's office, the executive vice president's office, and the academic vice president 's office are well documented. strong collections are also available for most of the professional schools of the university (particularly the college of arts and sciences, the graduate school of arts and sciences, the school of nursing, the school of education, and the school of management), the athletics department, and selected other offices. theses and dissertations. the university archives houses a complete collection of all honors and masters theses, as well as doctoral dissertations in paper form. more recent years are available as microfiche or microfilm copies in o'neill library. the microfiche or microfilm copy is considered the primary use copy. student organizations records. though substantial gaps exist in this area, there are still several useful collections. important student publications, such as the stylus , the heights , and the observer , are available. also of note are administrative records of organizations like the mendel club, the gold key society, and the dramatics society. personal papers. personal papers include faculty, staff, student and alumni papers. though occasionally such collections have administrative records, they consist mainly of personal materials. among these materials are items which document activities at boston college, or, in the case of faculty and alumni papers, the work of individuals who are well-respected in their field, and who have strong records of service to boston college and the larger community. many jesuit faculty collections have been preserved. of special note are the faculty collections of benedict alper, heinz bluhm, john louis bonn, lewis coser, everett c. hughes, john mcaleer, robert j. mcewen, and francis sweeney. boston college-related materials. these are made up of the records of committees, organizations, and institutions which are not technically part of the administration of boston college, but which enjoy a close relationship with the university. the most significant collections in this area are those relating to the boston college jesuit community and the newton college of the sacred heart. in the o'neill library: boston college theses and dissertations. though not as complete as the theses and dissertations collection in the burns library, an extensive collection of modern titles is available in microform. publications. o'neill library maintains copies of many publications of boston college offices. publications are cataloged and shelved according to their library of congress classification. in addition, microform sets of several key university publications, such as the heights , stylus , boston college chronicle and the earliest university course catalogs are available. collection parameters interdisciplinary elements of subject area formats and types of materials languages nearly all of the materials documenting the history of boston college are in english. some items, especially among the faculty papers, are in other languages. in general, materials are collected regardless of language as long as they record some aspect of university life. geographic areas (subject approach) while material is collected from any of the boston college campuses or locations of university offices, most of it originates from the main campus in chestnut hill. papers of individual faculty or alumni sometimes contain material originating in other parts of the united states or the world. time periods (subject approach) most of the collections in the university archives date from the late twentieth century. however, materials are collected which date from the nineteenth century (boston college was established in 1863) to the present. subject areas collected by record group the university archives is organized by record group. rg 0 external information on

artclub\u2019s fall faculty/staff show gives bc employees the opportunity to display their artwork to the boston college community. it serves as a platform for faculty and staff from both art-related and non-art departments to show side by side, which often results in engaging conversations between work due to the large breadth of subject matter and ideas dealt with. concurrently, the show calls to mind the universalities of the art-making process. the effect of the show on the bc student body is invaluable, as the work provides not only potential inspiration for student work but also reveals the hidden talents and interests of bc faculty. for art department faculty, the show provides students with a chance to personally engage with works they may have only heard about or seen in photographs and reproductions. about the student art gallery in the spring of 2004, bapst art library became the host for the first ever boston college student art gallery. the gallery is a joint endeavor of the bapst art library, the fine arts department, and art club, a student group for the promotion of the arts on campus. the gallery features a range of media including painting, sketches, watercolors, photography, and ceramic sculptures. students plan, jury, hang, and manage several exhibits throughout the year. you can view the archive listing here . updated: december 12, 2013

the subsequent book or article is really quite different from the original dissertation. in such cases, most publishers would not be worried that an open access etd was a prior publication. if students plan to publish a dissertation, they should consult potential publishers in their discipline beforehand if they are concerned that making their dissertation open access will jeopardize its chances of being published. students may also request an embargo period during which the full text of their dissertation will not be openly accessible. however, in some cases, the increased visibility due to open access without an embargo may increase the likelihood of your work becoming published. to better understand the effects of the open access decision and the embargo decision, please see open access and embargoes below. students with concerns about open access should refer to the following resources: frequently asked: etds and prior publication open access and scholarly publishing it is important to remember that even if a student agrees to make the dissertation available open access in escholarship, the student retains copyright to the work. open access and embargoes are these two choices related in any way? no, the decisions about open access (through bc\u2019s escholarship repository) and about an embargo are independent; any combination is possible - see table below. whatever decision you make about open access during the bc part of the submission process applies only to escholarship@bc. whatever embargo you request during the proquest part of the submission process will apply to both proquest and to escholarship. open access accepted open access declined no embargo (immediate availability of full text) at escholarship: full text available within weeks; no cost to you or the person viewing your etd. at escholarship: full text not available. at proquest: full text available in about 10 weeks. user or subscribing institution pays a fee. embargo (delayed availability of full text) at escholarship: after the embargo expires, full text available at no cost. at escholarship: full text not available. at proquest: after the embargo expires, full text available. user or subscribing institution pays a fee. copyright where can i get help with questions about copyright? the libraries have created a copyright and scholarship guide to answer basic copyright questions. if you need more help, please contact your subject librarian or the scholarly communication librarian . discovery and access how will researchers or potential employers discover my dissertation? choosing your key words and phrases carefully will enable other scholars to find your work easily. what search terms would they need? please provide at least one and up to six key words or phrases that describe the topic and content of your thesis. separate key words and key phrases with semicolons. note: subject specialists in the bc libraries can help you to optimize your choices of key words and phrases. here is a list of subject specialists and their contact information . please avail yourself of their services;

this is what boston college's main campus looked like from 1928 to the late 1940s. in the decades following the end of world war ii, boston college continued to grow and develop. additions to the chestnut hill campus included classroom buildings, athletic facilities, administrative offices, student residences, and cultural centers. three distinct sections emerged: lower, middle, and upper campus. in addition, the university expanded to other nearby areas, and the newton campus was created from facilities once occupied by the newton college of the sacred heart. the photograph at left was taken during the early 1970s, and shows the main campus as it existed around the time rev. j. donald monan, sj, assumed the office of president. for further study: several books and a number of articles have appeared in recent years which deal with the history of boston college and its campuses. in addition, the university archives houses many primary sources on this subject. contact a member of the burns library staff for further information. \u00ab back updated: october 13, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Boston College Campuses: Some Scenes From The Past,Summer 1997", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/burns.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "The Life and Career of Thomas P.

access to your work at no extra charge through boston college's website. by choosing to participate in open access, your electronic thesis or dissertation will be made available online for free at escholarship@bc, boston college's institutional repository. this will make your etd more accessible to the general public and will increase the visibility of your scholarly work online. at the same time, you\u2014as the author\u2014retain copyright. please be aware that you can both agree to open access on the boston college website and choose an embargo period through proquest, during which time the full text of your etd will not be available on escholarship@bc and proquest, thereby allowing yourself time to explore publishing possibilities, complete patent applications, etc. for further questions about open access and embargoes, see frequently asked questions . do you want an embargo? an embargo delays the online availability of the full text of an etd. embargoes are typically requested when: \u2022 a dissertation is being submitted to a publisher that proscribes prior disclosure; \u2022 a patent application is going to be filed; \u2022 there is a need to protect proprietary information; \u2022 or, there is a need to respect confidentiality. some graduate schools at boston college have adopted embargo policies whereby a request for an extended embargo may require approval. check with your school about individual policies. as of fall semester 2013, the following schools have embargo policies: gsas, lsoe, gssw. note: if you have an embargo and have agreed to the open access option, the full text of your etd will be available online for free once the embargo period has expired. for further questions about open access and embargoes, see frequently asked questions . do you want to allow search engine access on proquest? allowing search engine access simply allows other scholars to discover that your etd is in the proquest dissertations and theses full text database; they would be able to see its title, your name, and some descriptive information including the abstract. they would not be able to read its full text if it was under embargo. do you want proquest to register your copyright? registering your copyright is optional. doing so will allow you to bring suit if your copyright is infringed. proquest will register your copyright for a fee (about $55), or you can do it yourself by completing the registration process described on the united states copyright office website and paying a fee of $35. updated: october 18,

image courtesty of freedigitalphotos.net among the many anxieties that swirl in the mind of the graduate student - poised to click the submit button and deposit her dissertation - are these: can i incorporate material that i have already published as part of my dissertation? if i make this dissertation openly accessible, will a potential book publisher decline it because it is already published? these are both good questions and getting it right can have important consequences for the dissertation writer. the first question is more easily answered than the second. it arises fairly often, as graduate students are encouraged to publish, and some actually craft a dissertation out of their published articles. if you have published a journal article and want to incorporate that into your dissertation, your right to reuse the material will depend largely on the contract terms that you signed at publication. most graduate students are understandably thrilled to get a publication contract and don't think about negotiating the terms. they may sign away all their rights in a particular article to the journal publisher. the good news, however, is that many journal publishers have policies allowing the use of a published article in the author's own dissertation. elsevier, a publisher of many academic journals, often maligned for its rights policies, includes the following faq for authors: what rights do i retain as a journal author? ...the right to include the journal article, in full or in part, in a thesis or dissertation. the current american chemical society journal article publication contract , although quite restrictive in other ways, contains this language: 1. reuse/republication of the entire work in theses or collections: authors may reuse all or part of the submitted, accepted or published work in a thesis or dissertation that the author writes and is required to submit to satisfy the criteria of degree-granting institutions. don't wait until you are ready to click the submit button to wonder if you can include your previously published material in your dissertation. read and understand your publication contract, and make sure you have retained the rights you need. many publishers' websites also explicitly state what rights authors will retain. if you neglected this step and the publisher does not automatically allow publication in the dissertation, you can still ask the publisher for permission to include the article. your ability to embargo access to the dissertation for a period of a year or two may be helpful in getting the publisher to agree. will making my dissertation accessible make it difficult to publish? there are powerful reasons to make a dissertation openly accessible. making the work available for anyone to read can raise the scholar's visibility, increase citation counts, add to the knowledge in the field, help in finding a job, enhance the reputation of boston college, equalize access to knowledge in the developing world - the list goes on. still, this question is of great concern to students and it is important to make the decision based on the actual practices of academic publishers and their likely impact on the student's career. in 2011 five librarians surveyed the attitudes toward prior publication among 130 members of the american association of university presses and 616 high-impact journal publishers. the respondents were heavily weighted toward publishers of humanities and social science materials. in the article presenting their findings , the authors wrote: the key question was: which of the following statements best reflects the editorial policy or practice governing your enterprise? \"manuscripts which are revisions derived from openly accessible electronic theses or dissertations (etds) are...\" always welcome for submission considered on a case-by-case basis considered only if the contents and conclusions in the manuscript are substantially different from the etd considered only if the etd has access limited to the campus or institution where it was completed not considered under any circumstances other the findings are presented in the aggregate, but also separated for university press (mostly monographs) and journal publishers. of the aaup members, approximately three-fourths said that etds were always welcome, welcome on a case-by-case basis or welcome if very different. only 7 % indicated that etds would never be welcome. journal editors were more enthusiastic about receiving etds, with approximately 90% saying they were always welcome, welcome on a case-by-case basis or welcome if heavily revised. the authors of this article interpret the comments received from publishers to indicate that quality, revision and fit with the publisher's audience are the most important factors in determining whether an etd will be republished as a book or journal article. states : elsevier is liberal with respect to authors and electronic preprints. unlike some publishers, we do not consider that a preprint of an article (including a prior version as a thesis) prior to its submission to elsevier for consideration amounts to prior publication, which would disqualify the work from consideration for re-publication in a journal. the very conservative american chemical society evaluates the material on a case-by-case basis but offers caution : students and their mentors should be aware that posting of theses and dissertation material on the web prior to submission of material from that thesis or dissertation to an acs journal may affect publication in that journal. whether web posting is considered prior publication may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the journal's editor. if an acs journal editor considers web posting to be \"prior publication\", the paper will not be accepted for publication in that journal. if you intend to submit your unpublished paper to acs for publication, check with the appropriate editor prior to posting your manuscript electronically. in a recent blog post , kevin smith, scholarly communications officer at duke university, pointed out that perceptions of the prior publication problem are based more on fear, uncertainty and doubt than on evidence. he quoted the american historical association's fairly moderate statement on the issue: while there is no conclusive evidence that electronic publication can make it more difficult to publish a revised version of a dissertation, the division feels that students and their advisers should be aware of the possibility. editors who had spoken about the topic at a 2011 annual meeting session and had subsequently been interviewed for an article in the chronicle of higher education were divided on whether electronic publication differs significantly from older methods of making theses and dissertations available through interlibrary loan or on microfilm. some editors stated that they would be more likely to publish a dissertation that had attracted interest online. this last sentence refers to the fact that online publication may make it easier for a student submitting a revised dissertation to prove that there is substantial interest in the work, as evidenced by the number of downloads. smith expresses this opinion: revision of a dissertation before submission for publication is virtually a sine qua non today, and much more important than online availability (or suppression) of the original dissertation. because of the market described above, an unrevised dissertation, which is always directed to the interests of a very narrow group of specialized readers, stands little chance of being accepted, regardless of whether it is also online. more importantly, there is no evidence, in my opinion, that a publisher would reject a well-revised dissertation that was otherwise marketable simply because an earlier dissertation by the same author and on the same topic was online. availability as an etd is an excuse, or a boogeyman, far more often than it is a real reason for turning away a marketable monograph. in a recent communication to me, ellen faran, director of the mit press, stated a similar view, with the caveat that mit might not be typical and that there may be disciplinary differences: we see publishing as about connecting authors with readers, and book readers as different from the intended readers of a dissertation. we think that the major obstacle for publishing dissertations is not open posting but rather the question of audience, adapting the work for the appropriate book-buying audience. we usually do not consider a dissertation unless it has been thoroughly reworked into being a book rather than a dissertation. many dissertations can't be so adapted. thus we think that open posting may be less of a concern than phd students might think, because the book they can actually publish will have to be so different from the dissertation anyway. universities are uniformly struggling with what advice to give students about this issue. here is an excerpt from duke's advice: three often-repeated themes in university advice on this issue are: a book created from a dissertation is usually heavily revised and becomes a quite different work. publishers in different fields have different views on prior publication, and you should become familiar with the policies in your field. if you are in doubt, select a reasonable embargo period for your dissertation, keeping it in the dark until you have had a chance to negotiate with potential publishers. we agree with this advice and suggest that students strike a balance between the desire to have their work read, cited and added to the world's knowledge base, and the need to enhance potential appeal to publishers. if a book based on your dissertation is part of your career plan (and for many it is not), investigate some publishers' policies in your field. if in doubt, select a reasonable embargo period to allow yourself time to negotiate. but, base your decision on informed research, not on unfounded fear, uncertainty and doubt. a sampling of other universities' advice

adveniente, which announced the jubilee year, john paul ii remarks: \"as the third millennium of the new era draws near, our thoughts turn spontaneously to the words of the apostle paul, 'when the fullness of time had come, god sent forth his son, born of woman (gal 4:4).'\" this exhibit celebrates the jubilee year 2000, by focusing on the expression and practice of catholic efforts to secure social justice in the world. john a. ryan was perhaps the best known catholic voice on the social and economic order in early twentieth century america. ryan asserted that employers were morally obliged to provide their employees with a living wage; he also advanced proposals for the legislation of a minimum wage, as well as health and unemployment benefits - suggestions deemed radical at the time but now standard features of american economic life. in addition to his many lectures and articles as a professor of theology and political science, ryan served as director of the social action department of the national catholic welfare conference from 1921 until his death in 1945. his pamphlet the church and a better social order was published in dublin by the catholic truth society in 1948. thomas merton was one of the most important voices for peace in post-world war ii america. as a monk at the trappist abbey of gethsemani in kentucky, he tirelessly advocated the cause of peace in a time of war, both in vietnam and under the shadow of the arms race of the cold war. to the left is an image of the manuscript merton wrote when he received the pax medal in 1963. he calls for an end to the arms race and for nuclear disarmament, writing that such ideas are found not only in john xxiii's pacem in terris, but have their roots in the church fathers and in the gospels. but, merton laments, the fact that he is receiving this award shows that christians have not committed themselves to peace. for further study: more information on holdings of the burns library is available at the

exhibit highlights burns library ratio studiorum: jesuit education, 1540-1773 original exhibit fall 1999 this exhibit celebrates the 400th anniversary of the first promulgation of the ratio studiorum. it features examples from the extensive jesuitana collection in the burns library. as jesuit colleges proliferated in the first decades of the society, questions about curriculum and administration arose. furthermore, the need for standardization of classes and a desire for quality-control were increasingly pressing concerns. a number of attempts at drawing up such a blueprint were made: first in 1581, then again in 1586. after much discussion among educators in the society, a final plan was approved under the guidance of claudio acquaviva. the result was the ratio studiorum, first published in naples in 1598 and promulgated in 1599. francisco suarez was born in granada in 1548. he studied in salamanca and joined the society of jesus in 1564. suarez was ordained in 1572; for the following ten years he successively taught philosophy and theology at avila, segovia, and valladolid. he then spent five years teaching at the roman college until bad health caused him to return to spain. in 1597 he received his doctorate at evora and then took the chair of theology at coimbra, where he remained until 1615. his disputationes metaphysicae (salamanca, 1597) was the first systematic treatment of metaphysics not based exclusively on the texts of aristotle. suarez was influential not only for his writings on aristotle and philosophy, but for his work on scholastic theology as well; his commentaria ac disputationes in primam partem divi thomae (salamanca, 1595) shows how suarez brought his erudition to bear on an interpretation of the theological texts of aquinas. he died in lisbon in 1617. for further study: many books relating to jesuits are described in the jesuit collection in the john j. burns library of boston college, by john c. stalker. more items have been added to the holdings since the publication of stalker's work; to learn more, contact a member of the burns library staff. \u00ab back updated: october 13, 2010 maintained by:

fantasy jungle scenes with animals that portray the feelings and follies of human beings. the market scene held by the burns library shows his gift for using color and pattern to express the vibrancy of his culture. he also reveals a gentle sense of humor in his painting. this village dance scene was painted by die\u00f9donne rouanez in 1967. rouanez is now in his late seventies and has been

survey of the art of the book from the introduction of the vellum codex to the invention of printing and movable types. the burns library, german antiquarians dr. joern guenther of hamburg and dr. axel bender of dusseldorf, and a number of private collectors, including lorenz reibling, all contributed to the exhibit. this is a single leaf, pen-and-ink drawing on vellum, dating from 10th century germany. in the center of the leaf a man with halo is depicted dressed in an antique robe and bare-foot. he holds a preciously adorned book in his left hand, while raising his right hand in a gesture of benediction. the characteristic style of the figure suggests that this is a representation of christ, who quite often is rendered as a young man in carolingian and ottonian art, but likewise of a depiction of an evangelist. there is also an historiated border. the item is considered to be an artist's pattern sheet. this is a page from a book of hours illuminated on vellum by the master of gysbrecht van brederode in the netherlands, circa 1450/1475. the text includes a calendar of utrecht, hours of the virgin, prayers and suffrages, seven penitential psalms and litany, hours of the eternal wisdom, in praise of mary, long hours of the cross, and the office of the dead. the illumination consists of four full-page miniatures illustrating the annunciation, the last judgement, the ascension, and the burial of christ. a fifth illumination of pentecost may have been present at one time. this is a page from a first edition of the \"nuremberg chronicle,\" written by the nuremberg town physician and bibliophile hartmann schedel (1440-1514). nuremberg lay assessor sebald schreyer and the patrician sebastian kammermeister commissioned the book. the work was printed in 1493 by anton koberger, and includes 1809 woodcuts from 645 blocks, making it the most richly illustrated incunable. it features biblical cuts, views of cities, and a large map of germany, the first in a printed book. for further study: a 228 page catalog accompanies this exhibit and is available through the burns library. the publication features a bibliography which guides the reader to works of related interest. \u00ab back updated: october 13, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "The Art

exhibit fall 2001 this exhibit highlights the life of thomas and kathleen clarke and the struggle for irish independence in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. using the clarkes' lives as a unifying theme, the exhibit begins with the early influences of irish nationalism on thomas clarke's generation: the young ireland rebellion of 1848 and the rise of irish-american nationalism. the exhibit continues with discussions of the land war, the easter rising, the anglo-irish war, irish civil war, and the formal declaration of the irish republic, which was made official by the republic of ireland act in 1949. special attention is paid to the gaelic revival and the vital and often overlooked role played by women in achieving irish independence. featured in the exhibit are select items from the newly-acquired thomas and kathleen clarke collection, related material from the strong irish holdings at the burns library, and several items graciously lent for this exhibit by the boston public library. the clarke collection was acquired through the gil and kathleen lydon sullivan book fund of the burns library. photo of thomas clarke, former fenian and member of the irish

not only a love of reading, but by a love for the aesthetics of reading. they established co-operative enterprises in which their individual talents would contribute equally to the final product, and in which quality, not quantity, was the goal. beginning with selections produced by william morris's kelmscott press-an \"undertaking\" to which the fine print press owes its resurrection--the exhibition includes books from the golden cockerel press, curwen press, and gregynog press. special highlights are personal letters, engraved blocks, examples of fonts, and artwork from the eric gill collection, and examples of fine print books from the irish collection, featuring dun emer, later cuala, press, three candle press, dolmen press, and traffic street press. while william morris's admiration of medieval aesthetics and his ideas about the co-operative craftsmen of the middle ages brought the fine print press back from the brink of extinction in the late nineteenth century, this exhibition demonstrates that the conception of a beautiful book keeps pace with its contemporary cultural milieu. illustration by sir edward burne-jones from the complete works of geoffrey chaucer

band original exhibit fall 2004 featuring photographs, memorabilia, programs, and text from the michael cummings collection of p.s. gilmore, the exhibit emphasizes gilmore's role as bandmaster and organizer of the 1869 national peace jubilee and the 1872 world peace jubilee. patrick sarsfield gilmore, considered the \"father of the american concert band,\" was born in ballygar, ireland in 1829. after immigrating to the united states in 1849, p.s. gilmore settled in boston, where he began his long and illustrious career as one of america's foremost bandleaders and concert organizers. beyond his accomplishments as bandleader and concert organizer, p.s. gilmore was also a successful composer. one of his civil war songs, \"when johnny comes marching home,\" first appeared as part of the soldier's return march and was later published separately under the pen name louis lambert. from the 1850s to the 1870s, gilmore conducted some of the finest bands in the boston area, including the boston brigade band and the salem brass band. gilmore and his band established a yearly fourth of july concert on the boston common, and created a summer promenade concert series for the city. two of gilmore's grandest accomplishments came in 1869 and 1872, when he organized the national peace jubilee and the world peace jubilee. gilmore organized the national peace jubilee in 1869 to benefit the war widows and orphans of the civil war, and to celebrate the peace of war's end. a coliseum was specially built in boston for the jubilee, with seating for 30,000 audience members, 10,000 chorus members, and a 1,000 piece orchestra. the coliseum was by far the largest structure of its kind in the city. highlights from the festival included a performance of verdi's il trovatore , which included 100 boston firemen striking anvils, a battery of cannon, chimes, church bells, a huge bass drum 8 feet in diameter, and a gigantic organ specially built for the occasion. almost immediately after the end of the national jubilee, gilmore began planning for an even grander and more massive event, the world peace jubilee of 1872. once again, a coliseum was designed and built especially for the event. unfortunately the coliseum collapsed during construction, and a larger version of the 1869 coliseum was hurriedly erected in its place. despite this setback, the jubilee opened as scheduled in boston on june 17, 1872. for this 18-day festival celebrating the end of the franco-prussian war, gilmore gathered 20,000 choral performers, 2,000 instrumentalists, and such internationally famous organizations as johann strauss and his orchestra from austria, the grenadier guards band of england, the garde republicaine of france, and the prussian band of kaiser franz grenadiers. from 1873 to his death in 1892, gilmore conducted the 22nd new york regiment band, helping it become the foremost professional band in the united states. his funeral in new york was a grand affair, with a 100 piece marching band, a detail of 16 soldiers from new york's 22nd regiment, and a route, as described by a new york times obituary, \"thronged with people gathered to pay the only tribute in their power to the beloved musician.\" for further study: please contact the burns library irish music center at imc@bc.edu or 617-552-3956. the patrick s. gilmore society home page (maintained by the

(2) storing material in a way that will promote long term physical preservation; (3) queuing damaged items for conservation treatment; (4) describing material so that researchers can find what they need quickly and accurately. this may not sound that time consuming, but, when the collections are added up and factors of physical fragility, intellectual complexity, and third-party rights are multiplied across all of our holdings, it is quite a task! processing collections is the best way we get to know what we have and the only way we can make what we have available to you. after all, why have it if no one can use it? just what have we been focusing on while we have extra funding? we have a small team of archivists working on previously unavailable collections, all with some connection to the boston area. within this general theme, we've considered a number of factors to build our docket. we have given priority to researcher interest, length of time the material has been unavailable, physical volume, and organizational complexity. so far, one collection is available and four more will be fully described very shortly. following is a brief description of each of these newly available collections. john donnelly & sons records the john donnelly & sons records were the first to be processed. the business records of a well-known local outdoor advertising company, this collection serves as a great introduction to the kind of things we have in burns archives, and the diverse research interests they can serve. in addition to documenting the firm's business history (did you know the donnellys made several iconic local neon signs, including the shell sign in cambridge and the now-vanished gulf sign in kenmore square?), the records shed light on local history and politics as well as national social trends. a prominent irish catholic boston family, the donnellys knew the kennedys - the collection includes a charming photo of edward c. donnelly jr., at the beach with jack and joe at the donnelly's summer place in cohasset - and edward c. donnelly jr. was a staff member for former boston mayor james michael curley, whose daughter edward later married. their wide range of acquaintances, charitable activities, and political interests are recorded in the collection's many scrapbooks, which also detail the fascinating history of advertising. howard belding gill papers photograph of the 18th institute of correctional administration class, 1960. the howard belding gill papers, next in line, are the personal and professional papers of noted prison reformer and penologist howard belding gill (1890-1989). best-known as the first superintendent of the progressive norfolk prison colony from 1927-1934, gill had a long and distinguished career as a prison administrator and educator in corrections. he served as superintendent of prisons in washington, dc from 1944-1946 (when one of his prisoners was ezra pound, with whom he conversed and to whom he gave books), and founded the institute of correctional administration in dc in 1952 to train new generations of guards and administrators. he taught at the university of wisconsin, george washington university, and american university, and guest-lectured at boston college. his papers are a rich resource for those interested in criminology, penology, and progressive politics as they relate to corrections. stanbrook abbey press and elizabeth hayward ursuline academy materials the vought corsair. g. william patten papers available very soon will be the g. (george) william patten papers. these are the papers of a local memorial designer and artist who worked on the national shrine of the immaculate conception in washington, dc and had an unexpected wartime career as a draftsman drawing engineering schematics for vought aircraft corporation during wwii. patten was very interested in symbolism and iconography, and the collection includes his extensive notes on those subjects as well as many beautiful works of art. other collections being worked on up next are a couple of small collections and one voluminous one: the philip and mary mcniff papers containing primarily printed material and correspondence regarding catholicism and fine printing; bette's rolls royce restaurant materials, which document a restaurant located in boston near faneuil hall from 1970-1980 that was advertised by the flamboyant owner's yellow rolls royce illegally parked out front; and the citywide coordinating council records documenting the activities of the council, which was an independent oversight organization created by court order in 1975 to monitor implementation of boston's school desegregation plan. in addition to all this processing, we are recommending materials for digitization. look for more about these collections - and others! - on our blog and flickr , as well as in the news section of the libraries' website . for more information about conducting research or visiting with classes, see our library guide , contact our reference staff , or drop by during our open hours . amy braitsch head archivist, burns library adrienne pruitt project archivist, burns library questions, comments?

here is a quick summary of some of the more interesting findings: philosophy, theology, and the school of theology and ministry faculty respondents are the heaviest users of e-books (68%), followed by faculty respondents in the other humanities (54%). of those not using e-books (in all groups), the predominant reason appears to be lack of awareness that the bc libraries are collecting e-books (faculty - 68%, graduate students - 82%, undergraduate students - 82%). of those faculty using e-books at bc, 96% find them using the library system (formerly quest, now, holmes). faculty graduate students undergraduate students have you ever accessed e-books through the boston college libraries?

based on this feedback, here are some things that we'd like you to know: we still buy many print books, but we also have lots of e-books, and the numbers keep growing! here are examples of e-book collections the library has added recently. earlier this fall, we started adding project muse e-books : these are the e-books published by the 70+ university presses included in the upcc (formerly the university press e-book consortium (upec)), in collaboration with project muse. and, thanks to the very generous gift of dr. larry clifford honoring the late marilyn grant, bc chemistry librarian (1971 - 2003), we have added the full set of royal society of chemistry e-books for organic chemistry 2000 - 2010 as the marilyn grant memorial gift collection . downloading ... for pdf's it's easy ... and for pleasure reading, try overdrive virtually all of our e-book collections provide for downloading of chapters (usually in pdf). once you've downloaded the file, you can store it for reference at any time later. some of our collections allow downloading of the complete text; for example, the 243 titles in our 2011 palgrave connect collections in education, literature and religion/philosophy can all be downloaded in toto in either pdf or epub formats. and, if you're looking for pleasure reading books to download to your kindle, nook, ipad, etc., try out bc's overdrive service. scholarly publishers, on the other hand, have been slow to offer full-content downloading, placing more stringent \"digital rights management\" on their titles. the boston college libraries are working with other libraries in the boston library consortium to advocate for licenses that allow for broad usage rights including copying, printing, and multiple users. printing with only rare exceptions (acls humanities e-books is one), all of our e-book providers allow printing of multiple pages during a single session - ebrary , for example, with very few publisher-based exceptions, allows printing of 100 pages, or a full-length chapter, whichever is longer. with ebscohost, you can print 60 pages, then return later during a second session and print more, if needed. annotating we know that the ability to annotate pdf documents is an essential requirement for greater use of e-books by faculty and graduate students. indeed, many of our e-book platforms allow users to highlight and even keep notes on the e-books that they're reading. both the ebrary and ebscohost e-book platforms support direct note-taking and highlighting for users who have signed into their personal accounts. for e-book platforms where this is not a built-in feature, adobe reader 9 and higher supports annotation of pdf documents, as does the built-in preview for mac os x. this is also easily done on the ipad, for those reading there. see the e-books at boston college libguide for more information and more annotation software options. if you would like to know more about our findings, or give

jennings papers - burns library burns library has a significant collection of the papers of elizabeth jennings, the british poet who lived from 1926 to 2001. jennings, who published almost thirty books of poetry, several anthologies and critical works, was, and still is, a much loved writer whose books of poetry sold widely. in 1989 her editor at carcanet michael schmidt wrote to jennings that \"your books continue to sell very well indeed. statistically speaking, you are now unrivalled as our best-seller. indeed you must be one of the best-selling poets in england. ... few authors can claim the earned popularity that you now enjoy. i think it is wonderful and deserved.\" ( letter, 7 july 89 ). elizabeth jennings was born in boston, lincolnshiire, the daughter of henry cecil jennings, medical officer for the county. after graduating from oxford university, jennings worked as an assistant librarian at oxford city library from 1950-58 and then as a reader for the london publisher chatto & windus from 1958-60. from 1960 for the rest of her life jennings was a full-time writer. she began writing poetry early being encouraged by one of her schoolteachers as well as by an uncle, himself a poet. her earliest poetic inspirations were g. k. chesterton's \"battle of lepanto\", coleridge's \"the rime of the ancient mariner\" and the odes of keats. later on, edwin muir and robert frost were the two poets by whom jennings was most influenced. roman catholicism, the religion in which she was born, was extremely important to jennings throughout her life and not surprisingly spiritual concerns were important themes in many of her poems. jennings's poems were also characterized by strong logic, emotional sensitivity, an absence of vagueness, an avoidance of decoration, an eschewing of any mystification. she was always particularly interested in form and in the use of rhyme and meter. jennings is often included in the movement, a group of poets active in the late 1940s and later who strongly believed in simplicity in poetry and who avoided all decoration and pretentiousness in literature. nine poets are usually listed as comprising the movement - kingsley amis, robert conquest, donald davie, d. j. enright, thom gunn, john holloway, philip larkin, john wain and elizabeth jennings. though jennings was strongly attracted to the members' common purpose and principles, she stood apart in being the only woman and the only devout catholic among the group. she differed too from the other members in her strong dislike of irony, her espousal of spirituality, and her love for foreign parts, particularly italy. there are eighteen boxes of material in the burns library jennings collection. they contain numerous manuscripts of her poetry, both published and unpublished, from the period 1971-1997 comprising hundreds of both adult and children's poems. the collection also has manuscripts of published and unpublished prose works. these include introductions to books; most of an autobiographical essay published in the bloodaxe book of contemporary women poets without whom and an unpublished monograph, a brief study of t. s. eliot and his life . at the beginning of without whom jennings is quite specific about the primary themes of the work: this book is not an autobiography though it does contain some attributes of a life about oneself. there is a good deal about childhood, for example, but rather less about romantic love. it is intended to be about other people and, in two instances, about other places; to these people and these places i owe debts i can never repay adequately. jennings's modesty and regard for friends is evident in without whom : it has sometimes seemed to me that there is far too much egotism in autobiographies. of course, to write about myself does mean in large part to present yourself in the distorting mirror of self regard. however, the best autobiographies contain a great deal about other people, relations, friends, all those one has loved and been loved by. this book is intended to contain more of the latter than the former. i would not have written it \"without\" the good fortune which brought me in touch with some rare people and some great places to which i was given the golden key of liberty. this semi-autobiographical work also has a long section describing jennings's interacting with fellow poets while at oxford. it is interesting to read of her view of the american donald hall, who was later to become a very famous poet: ... the writer who brought us all together through sheer love of poetry was a young american called donald hall. he was doing research on english prosody and he lived at christ church. donald was a very tall young man but not at all slender. in fact one young graduate wit who had the rare distinction of taking a first class in mathematics at oxford and cambridge wrote this clerihew about him: donald hall is fat and tall but the ego inside the matter is taller and fatter. donald had quite enough humour to relish this. jennings relates in without whom that hall played a major role in introducing her and other young poets at oxford to such contemporary american poets as wallace stevens, richard wilbur, and robert lowell. wilbur was unknown to us while we had only read stevens and lowell in anthologies. with great generosity, donald gave me american editions of stevens and wilbur and they excited me and, i think, influenced my poems. the beautiful thick-paper editions of stevens's auroras of autumn and credences of summer and wilbur's things of the world became part of my poetic world. jennings's relating of when she first came across kingsley amis at oxford is amusing: i cannot really think why but when i saw kingsley amis's name up in the examination schools at oxford, i thought he would be a black man. was it the name? it certainly did not sound like an english christian name. was i muddling the name with kingston jamaica? i shall never know. i only know that when i told him about this he laughed very heartedly. the burns collection also contains jennings's monograph on eliot entitled a brief study of t.s. eliot and his life . this was never published, jennings's reason, as she observed in an october 1993 note accompanying the manuscript, was because \"the poet's widow will not cooperate with anyone writing about t.s.e.\" it is a relatively slight study though jennings's anecdotes and personal observations about eliot are surely enough to merit publication consideration: in 1960, i myself was lucky enough to have tea with eliot in 'uncle tom's cabin'. i found him much taller than i had expected, though slightly stooped, but he was, indeed, a very distinguished-looking and sensitive man. but, which is much more important, he was modest, gentle, kind and understanding; for example, i happened at the time of meeting him, to be working on a book about the relationship between poetry and mysticism, and he suggested several books that might help me. otherwise, we talked about edwin muir, a splendid poet whose papers eliot latterly published, and whom we both admired very much. eliot had previously made a selection of muir's poems and wrote a very appreciative introduction to the book. prominent among the correspondence in the burns library jennings papers is a letter from jennings to sir john gielgud, letters to jennings from, among others, priscilla tolkien cyen (jrr tolkien's daughter), roy fuller, john heath-stubbs, daniel day lewis, and sir alec guinness. in a 21st february, 1990 letter to jennings guinness provides very interesting observations on the controversial film director peter greenaway: peter greenaway. i found the draughtsman's contract fascinating to look at but couldn't join in the universal praise for it. zoo-something or other i found pretentious and un-understandable. a week or two ago he asked me to play gonzalo in his forth-coming film of the tempest - to be called prospero's books. john g. is to play prospero and all the parts up until the last \u00bc hour of film - when other actors materialize. it is so vividly written i was tempted. but then i came across a page of descriptions which nauseated me - unwarranted sadism and bloodiness - so i said no. there is a sickness in the air of his work - but it arrests the eye. the above extracts comprise only a tiny proportion of the fascinating material in the elizabeth jennings papers in the burns library. whether for pure pleasure or for more scholarly purposes you are most welcome to come to burns to read more. brendan rapple collection development librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston

2012 volume 14 number 1 fall 2012 the library joins the center for research libraries this past summer, the boston college libraries became a full member of the center for research libraries , an international consortium of research libraries which has developed an extraordinary resource for scholars and students of member institutions. crl's main purpose is to provide research materials and services not easily available from anywhere else. its collections have been built over the past six decades through a collaborative effort by subject area experts at member institutions and by researchers requesting hard-to-obtain material from around the world. the types of resources include dissertations, journals, newspapers, pamphlets, music scores, photographs, and archives, among others. here are some examples: more than 35 historical latin american newspapers in digital format published between 1805 and 1922. ( more information ) digitized pamphlets and periodicals from the french revolution of 1848. ( more information ) more than 800,000 doctoral dissertations and habilitationsschriften from universities outside of the u.s. and canada. ( more information ) materials produced in the united states and international resources related to water conservation, watershed development policies, and water quality. ( more information ) records of official tribunals, courts, truth commissions, and investigations of human rights violations. ( more information ) 43 microfilm reels of sir isaac newton's manuscripts and papers. ( crl catalog record ) collection of photographs on 35 microfilm reels from the agence meurisse news agency consisting of 34,518 images organized in chronological order from 1909-1937, evoking the immediacy of events spanning the first half of 20th-century europe. ( crl catalog record ) papers of the naacp dealing with the scottsboro case, 1931-1950. these include legal files, newspaper clippings, and correspondence among the naacp, the international labor defense, and the scottsboro defense committee, as well as with numerous private individuals and other organizations (microfilm). ( crl catalog record ) music collection of christ church, oxford including unpublished manuscripts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries of about 1,200 pieces of sacred, secular, instrumental and vocal music (60 microfilm reels). ( more information ) trail - technical report archive & image library: digitized federally funded technical reports issued before 1975. space exploration, alternative energy sources, nuclear reactors, mining, and water purification are among the topics in more than 20,000 documents summarizing engineering and regulatory investigations. ( more information ) finding crl material there are several ways of searching this treasure trove of information. use the crl catalog. its simple keyword search page includes a list of helpful search tips and a link to the advanced keyword search page . use worldcat local and limit your search to the center for research libraries, an option in the drop down menu on the basic search screen or in the drop down menu in the narrow your search / library section of the advanced search mode. browse the collections portion of the crl website, especially the digital collections and topic guides sections. also, in the near future, crl records for its collections' digital resources will be added to holmes , the online catalog for boston college. getting crl material once a potentially useful dissertation, microfilm set, serial volume, monograph, or other physical item is identified, members of the bc community can request it through interlibrary loan . one advantage in using worldcat local is that it includes links to the interlibrary loan form, thereby facilitating the request process. while there is no formal loan period (!), crl materials are subject to being recalled. crl as research partner the advantages of membership extend beyond access to crl's collections. librarians and scholars can recommend purchases, request a research consultation, recommend items for digitization, and participate in webinars focusing on particular research collection areas. crl has collaborated on numerous collection building projects, for example: the cooperative african newspaper project and its online union list of newspapers published in sub-saharan africa. the collaborative initiative for french language collections digital library of the caribbean . (this particular project is a good example of a crl-related project in the process of starting up and recruiting volunteer experts ) the slavic and east european microform project (seemp) with its microform sets of hard-to-get newspapers, books, periodicals, pamphlets, and manuscripts. crl has also been a boon to librarians who are considering the purchase of expensive electronic resources. by providing in-depth analyses , crl helps librarians assess major databases and digital collections being produced by commercial publishers and other sources. it also issues reports on important digital preservation programs and services, an activity increasingly vital to the future of the scholarly record given the greater and greater use of the digital format in publishing. and there's still more... given the scope of all that crl offers, the best introduction would be a leisurely visit to its website focus , and e-mail update, crl connect . collection building is at the heart of what it does, and forums visit crl in its chicago facility and make on-site use of its resources. if you have any questions about crl, please don't hesitate to contact your subject librarian . jonas

libraries: value beyond discovery welcome back! we've been busy while you were gone and most of what we've been doing should reflect things we heard from you before the spring term ended. the most evident change has occurred on level one in the o'neill library. this floor has been part of an ongoing transformation for the past several years. this summer we removed the old blue shelving and replaced it with open, mixed landscape seating. the new space takes advantage of natural light, and provides comfortable seating and diner-style study booths. moreover, level one also has a new open collaboration room that has been created with moveable furniture and floor to ceiling white boards. yes, you can write on the walls. no reservations necessary! we also implemented alma, a new integrated library system. alma uses cutting-edge cloud-based technology and provides a solid technical infrastructure that will enable us to better manage our resources and build innovative new library services. later this year, we plan to begin developing personalized online library content and services which use the alma platform, and we will certainly be soliciting your feedback and suggestions. we realize that there have been some bumps in the road as we have moved forward with the new system. this is to be expected, as the alma implementation is the culmination of a three-year development partnership between boston college and ex libris, and we are the first library in the world to go live with the system. we continue to work closely with our partners to ensure that we build digital library services commensurate with the bc library motto: \"value beyond discovery.\" in addition to these two higher profile projects, we have been increasingly collaborative with faculty and students, providing research consultation, courses and learning opportunities with our special collections, and a redoubling of our efforts to make the libraries the very best possible in terms of spaces, services and collections. as always, we value your suggestions and observations. tom wall university librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board .

display in this exhibit were loaned to the burns library from dr. joseph brennan, boston college class of 1933 and professor emeritus of philosophy at barnard college and the u.s. naval war college. indeed, it was dr. brennan who supplied not only the materials but also the concept for the exhibit. his long-time interest in mann is indicated by his many books and articles on the famous german author who won the nobel prize for literature in 1929. aware that a number of new biographies and new english translations have followed the recent release of the complete text of mann's diaries and that this has caused renewed interest in the relation between mann's storytelling art and his personal life, dr. brennan conceived the idea of displaying from his own collection material relating to mann and his work. this portrait of thomas mann was done in charcoal by mary mcleod brennan after a visit with joseph to thomas mann and his wife katia at their house in princeton, new jersey, in 1941. mary lived in stony brook with her husband until her death in january of 1996. they would have celebrated their 59th wedding anniversary on june 7th, 1997, one day after mann's birthday date, june 6th. for further study: this exhibit was first mounted at the emma s. clark memorial library of the naval war college in june of 1996, with the assistance of constance sobel. for additional information on holdings of the naval war college relating to either joseph brennan or thomas mann, contact a member of the library staff at that institution. the boston college archives also houses a small collection of papers of joseph brennan. more information on these materials can be had by contacting a member of the burns library staff. \u00ab back updated: october 13, 2010 maintained by:

conservator of the john j. burns library in january 2009, after being employed as book conservator at the boston athenaeum for more than 18 years. i kept abreast of current conservation practices and received training in emergency response through the athenaeum\u2019s generous professional development program. prior to working at the athenaeum i was trained in bookbinding at the north bennet street school in february of this year i gave a presentation for the boston college library staff, showing recent work i had executed while at the boston athenaeum. a book which attracted considerable interest during this presentation was the india wharf rats ledger book from the 1880s. the india wharf rats, a boston men\u2019s dinner club founded in 1883, kept records of menus and guests in this commercially bound volume. the book was also embellished with charming sketches drawn by club members. india wharf rats ledger- before and after click to enlarge this book and subsequent ledger books were stored in the club kitchen over the stove. unfortunately, a stove fire caused fire and smoke damage to the books. in the photos (left) you can see the smoke and fire-damaged book as it appeared prior to treatment, and the volume as it now appears after completion of the conservation treatment. this represents, of course, just one of thousands of treatments done by me while at the athenaeum. in my tenure there i had the great privilege of working on books from the collections of george washington, general knox, john quincy adams, and king\u2019s chapel, as well as on other significant 18th and 19th century imprints and manuscripts. additionally, my tasks included the preparation of exhibition supports for books and writing articles about athenaeum collections. my work here at boston college has proven just as interesting. i have had a very productive first quarter at the john j. burns library, becoming familiar with the building, collections, and boston college staff. i took down one exhibition, installed another, and completed important bench work. i have trained student workers and interns regarding the safe handling of books and archival materials. our bookbuilders of boston interns, meaghan ryan \u201809 and mike pesce \u201809, have received instruction from me, learning about the parts of a book, paper production and repair, monitoring climate in rare book libraries, medieval colors and their production, staple removal, and how to make decorative paste papers. they have completed two conservation related projects as part of their internship; in the adjacent photo you see them proudly showing some of their work to the staff at burns library. they successfully completed paste paper covered hand-sewn pamphlets and created protective enclosures. it has been a pleasure to work with them, their enthusiasm for books always brightened my day. manuale sodalitatis b. mari\ufffd virginis - before and after click to enlarge early in this quarter i met with burns staff to discuss the conservation needs of their dedicated collections. after these discussions, i executed a number of conservation treatments and completed treatment reports with photo documentation. one example of work done on the jesuitana collection is shown here (left), a volume entitled manuale sodalitatis b. mari\u00e6 virginis, ac iuuentutis uniuers\u00e6 select\u00e6 gymnasiorum societatis iesu, miraculis dict\u00e6 sodalitatis illustratum . the title page required surface cleaning and re-attachment, and a number of the pages of the text block were dog-eared. before and after treatment condition is shown in the accompanying photos. i have repair plans in place for additional jesuit imprints, as well as the other numerous special collections here at the burns library. i have begun a major preventive conservation project: storage modification for the rare materials kept in the treasure room; a storage room for the finest materials in the burns library. stage one, lining the flat files and attaching handles to the drawers, is already completed. the second stage of this project, creating custom drop-spine boxes for treasure room books, is underway. three such boxes, shown on my work bench in the lab (right), now protect rare books in the treasure room. in addition to meeting with burns staff, i have met with other boston college library staff members. the all-staff meetings at the o\u2019neill library have been useful both for gaining an understanding of current boston college procedures and for getting acquainted with library colleagues. i also have met with boston college staff such as the hvac personnel; all have provided invaluable advice on the burns library climate system. my first months have been an excellent start to my career at boston college, and this next quarter offers more opportunities to attain greater knowledge about the burns library, its collections, and its exhibition needs. barbara

archives boston college libraries recently purchased the digital papers of two major political figures of the 20th century: winston churchill and joseph stalin. stalin digital archive is the result of years of collaboration between the russian state archive of social and political history (rgaspi) and yale university press. it provides unprecedented access to historically significant content, covering the most momentous events of the twentieth century: two world wars, several revolutions in russia and china, the cold war, and the dawn of the nuclear age. stalin's personal papers provide us with unparalleled information on the development of key historical events from the point of view of the major participant and decision maker. (j. arch getty). the rgaspi documents from stalin's personal papers will eventually number over 400,000 pages. additional highlights include: communications during the great purges, relations with western intellectuals and leaders, and private notations on many soviet leaders. churchill archive offers for the first time electronic access to the personal and official papers of winston s. churchill. provided by bloomsbury publishing and drawing from the collections of the churchill archives centre, churchill college, cambridge university, this new resource offers increased access and new insight into churchill himself and the 20th century events in which he played such a key role. it includes more than 800,000 pages of original documents, produced between 1874 and 1965, ranging from churchill's personal correspondence to his official exchanges with kings, presidents, politicians, and military leaders. the site can be searched by keyword or browsed by a special taxonomy drawn from the existing churchill archives centre catalogue. these include browsing by: people -- individuals mentioned ten times or more throughout the archive, both contemporaneous and historical figures: from mahatma gandhi to harry truman to benjamin franklin . place -- countries, cities, seas, islands mentioned ten times or more: from cuba to ireland to syria . topics -- nested categories covering areas of governance, international relations, political beliefs and more: from the treaty of versailles to colonialism to temperance . period -- years grouped by phases of churchill's personal and political life: from his ancestors to his birth to the annotated notes of some of his greatest speeches before parliament. the database offers churchill scholars, and all scholars of history, political science, and the 20th century, a nearly century-long window into the history of imperial britain, the first and second world wars, anglo-american relations, the dawning of the cold war, and more. nina bogdanovsky subject specialist, o'neill library elliot brandow subject specialist, o'neill library questions, comments?

as the type of content i'm envisioning encompasses far more than the traditional library skills taught by librarians, i believe that in most cases the teacher would be a regular faculty member who could indeed be aided by a librarian. obviously each institution will determine what precise information literacy content is included, how it is taught and by whom, as well as numerous other particulars. however, the primary step is to recognize the critical necessity that students, in addition to learning more narrowly focused library skills, also be instructed in the pervasive role of information in its many forms throughout society. today's educated individual requires this knowledge. in conclusion, at a time when boston college is reviewing the goals and content of its core curriculum i respectfully propose, as a strategy for making such education a reality, that consideration be given to including it as part of the college's new core. brendan rapple collection development librarian questions, comments?

might those changes include the kinds of resources you are using for research? in an effort to gauge the extent to which approaches to identifying and using research resources are changing, a survey of faculty was carried out in september 2012 by ithaka strategies and research , a service provided by ithaka , a nonprofit organization which includes jstor , an online archive of scholarly journals and one of the library's most popular resources. it confirmed what many of us perceive is the case: scholars are doing more and more of their research in the electronic medium. for example, the ithaka survey results indicate that the majority of scholars across the disciplines have become very comfortable with relying on e-journals. though representing a low percentage of all respondents, a rising number of faculty believes that e-books will eventually replace print (9% of respondents in 2009, 16% in 2012). and a significant percentage (over 60%) look for free material on the web, a research strategy that may become more popular as the amount of reliable and authoritative free material on the web continues to increase. boston college libraries' collections have certainly entered the digital age. bc faculty are heavy users of the library's e-journal collection, and the e-book collection of current scholarly monographs, while still quite small compared with the print collection, is growing. but where is all this heading? what will library collections look like in the future? will research resources eventually all be digital, or will they be a combination of digital and print and other analog formats? these and other questions regarding the role of libraries are being asked and pondered throughout the academic library world. in my following remarks, i will be drawing on articles by several librarians summarizing current thought and practice regarding the future of collections. it is now generally agreed that libraries can no longer be viewed simply as warehouses of physical research materials. perhaps that image was never an acceptable representation of a library to begin with. mark sandler has written \"libraries are not about books; they were, are, and will be about facilitating communication across time and space\" (sandler, p. 240). this view echoes one i've heard before about the library as the place where one can go to have a conversation with the greatest minds of the past. traditionally, print books and journals have been the most common forms of scholarly communication, a reality exemplified by the millions of volumes currently on library shelves. they represent the scholarly record of centuries of research. but clearly they are now only part of a larger information landscape which includes significant digital resources such as arxiv.org , perseus digital library , american memory , europeana , hathitrust , gallica , and digitale sammlungen (all of which are freely available on the web!). given this larger landscape of resources, perhaps the basic question for any research library today is: what is a research collection in the digital age? given the rapid increase in the amount of information being produced in digital and analog formats, libraries need to decide what their approach will be to making it available to faculty and students. more and more, ownership will need to be complemented by the kind of access the library's interlibrary loan or ill provides because academic discovery tools like holmes and search engines like google and google scholar inclusion in the catalog and/or adding them to research guides as in this example of a list of free (and subscribed) websites on nanoscience and nanotechnology. what is a research collection in the digital age? given the multiplicity of options that have emerged thanks to the remarkable innovations in information technology, each university and college will need to answer this question in a way that meets its users' needs. in order to keep collections relevant to the needs of the boston college community, librarians will be monitoring developments in publishing, new trends in scholarship and research methodology, and the growth of freely available digital information. but the most important factor in any successful collection building program is the faculty-librarian relationship. the quality of the library's current collection is in large part the result of faculty input in the past, so please keep your collection requests coming! and for their part, librarians will continue to inform you about what's available to support your teaching and research, and are eager to share what they are learning about this all-too-rapidly changing information environment and its impact on scholarly communication. jonas barciauskas head of collection development sources hazen, dan. \"rethinking research library collections: a policy framework for straitened times and beyond.\" library resources & technical services 54, no. 2 (2010): 115-121. available . horava, tony. \"challenges and possibilities for collection management in a digital age.\" library resources & technical services 54, no. 3 (2010): 142-152. available . housewright, ross, roger c. schonfeld, kate wulfson, ithaka s + r. \"ithaka s + r us faculty survey 2012.\" available . sandler, mark. \"collection development in the age [day] of google.\" library resources & technical services 50, no. 4 (2006): 239-243. available . questions, comments?

letter written by gerard manley hopkins to a friend in 1862, from the hopkins family papers summer 2013 proved a busy time at the john j. burns library. summer researchers tend to be working on long-term research projects, spending weeks at a time in the burns reading room looking at large portions of collections or entire collections. popular manuscript collections this summer included the graham greene papers , donnelly and sons records , jane jacobs papers and the hopkins family papers . this wide selection of collections ranging from a nineteenth century poet's family papers and correspondence, to the advertising materials of boston based company donnelly & sons to the papers of urban planning activist jane jacobs reflects the range of interests among researchers as well as the breadth of the collections at burns. we thought you might be interested to learn more about the work of two particular researchers, whose projects will result in publications about burns library collections. graduate student catherine ahearn of boston university visited the reading room this summer so that she could look at all the books of flann o'brien's library. burns holds the libraries of several authors, including that of flann o'brien (one of the pseudonyms of comic irish writer brian nolan). most researchers examine only a few volumes of an author's library so this project was exciting and for staff and researcher alike. o'brien's library consists of well-read volumes including a guidebook on how to have better eyesight without glasses, a two volume set of ulysses, and many copies of his own novels. filled with annotations and signatures, o'brien's library offers a glimpse into the author's literary life. while doing her research, ahearn examined each book, recording descriptive details of a text such as any inscriptions and dates written within the front matter. ahearn plans to publish her findings in the parish review , the journal of the international flann o'brien society (ifobs). if you are interested in receiving updates on the ifobs conference and a copy of the e-journal the parish review , send your e-mail address to viennacis.anglistic@univie.ac.at . canadian author richard greene visited the burns reading room over the summer to peruse the graham greene papers. richard is currently working on a new biography of graham greene, which has been authorized by the greene estate. this book follows richard greene's 2007 book graham greene: a life in letters . the new book will be titled involvements: the life and times of graham greene and greene's general plan is to focus on his travels and writings about troubled places such as mexico, haiti, and vietnam. for more information about richard greene, take a look at his website . although richard and graham share the same last name, they are not related! in addition to our daily work with researchers, burns staff members also posted weekly articles on the burns blog over the summer. shelley barber, the burns reference and archives specialist, researched the journal of henry lyon, a british sailor who kept an account of his involvement in the first opium war of 1842 . enid karr, senior reference librarian/bibliographer at o'neill library wrote a post about her experience putting together the \"father linehan at operation deep freeze\" exhibit and the challenges and excitement of working with realia, including two model penguins. we also published two posts on the current exhibits in the burns library. senior special collections cataloging assistant jay moschella wrote about \"recusant books, or catholike life & literature in an age of persecution\" and posted a flickr set of images from this exhibit. former reading room student assistant james daryn henry wrote about the connections between boston college and anglo-american catholic writer and monk thomas merton in \"exhibitions update: working for the jesuits.\" in the last blog post of the summer, burns conservator barbara adams hebard highlighted the unexpected discoveries that sometimes characterize work in special collections. check out the burns facebook page , the burns blog and the burns flickr

made a name for herself as an entertainer and entrepreneur on the new york stage and beyond. after being passed over for a teaching position at the national school in kilteevan in 1910, annie left for america, where she hoped that her abilities would be better appreciated. in 1926, after her husband john mcnulty\u2019s untimely death, annie settled in new york city with her children eileen (aged 11) and peter (aged 9) and soon established the mcnulty family as a radio act. with the success of their radio show, the irish showboat , came recording opportunities, and their song and dance

chicago police captain francis o\u2019neill from tralibane, co. cork. francis o\u2019neill left ireland at the age of 16 to travel on a british merchant ship, and ended up settling in chicago. he joined the police force in 1873 and rose quickly in the ranks. a flute player himself, he came to know many other irish immigrant policemen in chicago who played traditional irish dance tunes on fiddle, pipes, and flute. together with fiddle player james o\u2019neill (from county down), francis o\u2019neill compiled the music book, o\u2019neill\u2019s music of ireland: eighteen hundred and fifty melodies, from fellow chicago musicians and from print sources. o\u2019neill\u2019s 1903 book, acclaimed by musicians, is still considered the most authoritative collection of traditional irish melodies ever published in a single volume. o\u2019neill later published several other music books, as well as two reference books on music. for more information on captain francis o\u2019neill, see

song formed in greenwich village, new york city in the mid-1950s by brothers paddy, tom, and liam clancy (born in carrick-on-suir, ireland) and tommy makem (originally of keady, co. armagh, and son of noted singer sarah makem), the clancy brothers and tommy makem exemplify the cross-cultural influences of irish traditional song and american folk music. the group\u2019s unconventional instrumentation of traditional irish songs comes from their residency in greenwich village, which in the 1950s and 60s was the center of american folk music. while pursuing acting careers in greenwich village, the clancy brothers, with tommy makem, sang traditional irish songs on the side to supplement their income. their concert repertoire initially puzzled listeners, who expected to hear sentimental numbers such as \u201cdanny boy\u201d and \u201cwhen irish eyes are smiling,\u201d rather than rebel songs such as \u201cbrennan on the moor.\u201d many songs known to the clancy brothers and tommy makem through irish tradition were unfamiliar to irish-american audiences. borrowing from the american folk tradition, the group accompanied their traditional songs with guitar, and later five-string banjo. liam clancy maintains that both the specific instrumentation, and the presence of any accompaniment in their music, are a product of american influence. clancy brothers singing rising of the moon * the group\u2019s appearance on the ed sullivan tv show in 1961 cemented their fame as a musical force, helping the clancy brothers and tommy makem bring the oral tradition of irish song to a broad american audience, including the occasional irish language song. for irish american listeners, the success of the clancy brothers and tommy makem was a dramatic departure from the commercial songs of tin pan alley. record sales, concert receipts, and the assertions of contemporary artists attest to the importance of the group in both irish \u201ctraditional\u201d and american folk contexts. the clancy brothers and tommy makem also had a tremendous impact in ireland following their american successes. liam points out that listeners in ireland \u201cwere really rediscovering their own music through the touch of americana that we added by bringing guitar, banjo, and pennywhistle to the traditionally unaccompanied music.\u201d tommy makem left the group amicably in 1969 to pursue a solo career, and each member of the original lineup has met with success in acting, composing, television, or performing. for more information on the clancy brothers and

2007 newsletters, i outlined several multimedia resources available on the internet and through boston college. the amount of video content has grown quickly since my last entry. for this article, i have decided to focus on a few key education and commercial video resources. please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, or if you come across some great resources i might have missed! just a warning... many of these are free sites, so they will have advertising content. historical there are several historical and cultural multimedia collections and initiatives available online. one of my favorites is the living room candidate from the american museum of the moving image. the living room candidate is an innovative online exhibition presenting more than 250 television presidential campaign commercials from every election year beginning in 1952 and ending with our most recent election of 2008. users can watch nearly four hours of tv commercials and explore the expanding world of web-based political advertising. the site includes a searchable database and features commentary, historical background and context, election results, and navigation organized by both year and theme. you can also search commercials based on themes (taxes, civil rights, change, etc.), as well as by commercial type (fear, background, biographical, etc.). another great site, though it is not as organized or 'pretty' as the living room candidate , is american rhetoric from speech bank. american rhetoric provides free downloadable and steaming audio of historical speeches and interviews. they feature over 100 original recordings (and supporting text and video) of the most important speeches delivered through the 20th century to the present day. most of the speeches are political in nature, by presidents such as john f. kennedy, richard m. nixon, franklin d. roosevelt, and our president- elect barack obama. the site also includes speeches from democratic and republican national conventions, commencements, legal proceedings, and famous orators like martin luther king, jr. and malcolm x. from their most accessed speeches you will hear a wide range of history. finally, the american memory collection from the library of congress tries to incorporate written and spoken words, sound recordings, still and moving images, prints, maps, and sheet music into an online module to document the american experience. american memory is a free and open access digital record of american history and creativity. the intention of these materials and collections, from the library of congress and other institutions, is to serve the public as a resource for education and lifelong learning. cultural and archival if your interest is in finding full length independent documentaries about american folk and roots culture, then i recommend folkstreams . folkstreams partners with several divisions of the university of north carolina at chapel hill ( ibiblio.org , school of information and library science, and the southern folklife collection) and is funded with grants by the national endowments, the institute for museum and library services, as well as state arts and humanities organizations. by creating an online database of streaming films, folkstreams accomplishes two goals: they've built a national preserve of hard-to-find documentary films about american folk or roots culture and they've given them new life by streaming them on the internet. the films in folkstreams begin in the 1960s and focus on the culture, struggles, and arts of americans from many different, and very often unnoticed, regions and communities. two more online collections focusing on archival and news footage are newsfilm online from the british universities film and video council and the moving image archive from the internet archive . newsfilm online has produced 67 news stories and associated clips which are freely accessible and may be browsed by decade or theme. newsfilm online also offers a subscription access to over 3,000 hours of digitized news stories spanning the 1910s to the present day, including some primary research materials, as well as television news and cinema newsreels. the internet archives ' moving image collection displays a wide range of footage and user uploads. full length feature films (now in the public domain), newsreel and commercial footage, and the prelinger archives (60,000 hours of 'ephemeral' -- advertising, educational, industrial, and amateur-- films), are all a part of the moving image archive. how to one of the most interesting digital video trends that have been popping up online are 'how to' or tutorial sites. one pertaining to online research and technology is the in plain english series from commoncraft . commoncraft is a husband and wife team that set out to create simple explanations of web 2.0 technology and some associated online tools. not sure what an rss feed is? phishing ? wonder why people twitter or use social networking sites? they have recently stopped producing videos themselves, but their library is small and useful. expertvillage , howcast , and howstuffworks-video center expertvillage aims to pair professional videographers and ' experts ' in a field to create a series of videos covering a particular topic. both need to complete an application process and make their credentials available. howcast is designed to bridge the gap between user-generated videos and more professionally produced videos. from their website, \"howcast brings together the personality of user-generated content with the quality of a professional video studio to create engaging, informative, and free how-to videos for consumers. it also offers emerging filmmakers an opportunity to gain experience, exposure, and income.\" howstuffworks was started in 1998 by marshall brain as a website and a book series geared towards students and teachers. from the website, \"our premise is simple: demystify the world and do it in a simple, clear-cut way that anyone can understand.\" hsw is now owned by the discovery channel (of discovery communications, inc. ) and the video center is just a small part of the overall website. the environment speaking of the discovery communications, inc. and its subsidiaries, there are several multimedia collections available online that are meant to be teaching and learning resources about the environment, the earth, and its many forms of wildlife. the arkive project has access to the very best of the world's wildlife films and photographs, with more than 1,500 of the world's leading filmmakers and photographers actively contributing to the project, and giving arkive unprecedented access to their materials. contributors include the most famous names in natural history broadcasting, commercial film and picture agencies, leading academic institutions and international conservation organizations, as well as myriad individual filmmakers, photographers, scientists and conservationists. arkive also has the backing of the world's leading conservation organizations, including birdlife international, conservation international, iucn, unep-wcmc, and wwf, as well as leading academic and research institutions, such as the natural history museum, london; royal botanic gardens, kew; and the smithsonian institution. arkive's web-based materials reciprocally link with and highlight the work of these organizations and others, helping to promote their activities to arkive's wide civil-society user base. arkive also contributes to the encyclopedia of life . the encyclopedia of life (eol) is an ongoing and ambitious project to organize and make available via the internet virtually all information about life present on earth. some of the institutional partners are the biodiversity heritage library, the field museum of natural history, and the marine biological laboratory. eol is a series of web sites\u2014one for each of the approximately 1.8 million known species. each species site is constantly evolving and features dynamically synthesized content ranging from historical literature and biological descriptions to excellent images, videos and distribution maps. one pattern you can see in all these multimedia sites is the representation and need of partnerships. whether it is from libraries, archives, corporations, or the users themselves, these sites would not exist without time and monetary investments and contributions. i hope some of these sites were of interest to you and i hope to share more in the near future. there is so much content on the web - it helps to share some, because very often it leads to a new and interesting resource! julie decesare digital media reference librarian

congressional reports in burns library recently burns student tom fraatzhe , whilst accessioning folio-sized uncataloged books in the burns library, discovered a large (41 documents-long) bound-with that had a blue library binding. a \"bound-with\" is simply a collection of works \u2013 usually pertaining to the same topic \u2013 that the owner has had bound together in the same binding. view sampling as it turned out, the contents of this binding contained united states congressional reports from the first few sessions of the u.s. congress in the early 1790's! the majority of these reports, which are typically 2-8 pages long \u2013 a few, though, are closer to 40-50 pages \u2013 were from the dept. of the treasury, which is to say alexander hamilton, but there are a smattering of other worthies amongst this group: thomas jefferson, david rittenhouse, henry knox, tench coxe, and george washington. so these are the official documents of the 1st president of the united states, the 1st secretary of state, the 1st secretary of the treasury, the 1st secretary of war, the 1st attorney general, the 1st postmaster general, etc. interestingly, this compilation of some of the most important documents in our nation's history has been in the bc collections for years. the first item in the volume bears a black ink stamp that identifies the book as belonging to \u201cboston college library, chestnut hill, mass.\u201d even more interesting is the original provenance of the book: these documents were compiled and bound together subsequent to publication by one jeremiah smith (1759-1842), a member of the house of representatives from march 4, 1791 \u2013 july 26, 1797. smith represented new hampshire's at-large district and later became new hampshire's 9th governor, from june 8, 1809 \u2013 june 5, 1810. his hand is present in the form of a manuscript table of contents that spans 3 pages as well as an essay on \u201cfree trade\u201d towards the back of the book. smith's hand was quite beautiful; his essay is very easy to read. as i went through each of these reports i could literally see a nation being built: the methods devised to derive revenue to pay off the debt our ancestors had incurred fighting a war of independence, arguments concerning standards for weights and measures, the plans for setting up a national defense force, the establishment of a national postal system, investigations into allegations of election fraud, etc. etc. for example, in report of the secretary of state, on the subject of establishing a uniformity in the weights, measures and coins of the united states. published by order of the house of representatives (1790) we learn that thomas jefferson had advised the government to adopt the following measures of length (and i quote here from p. 17 of that document): let the foot be divided into 10 inches; the inch into 10 lines; the line into 10 points; let 10 feet make a decad; 10 decads a rood; 10 roods a furlong; 10 furlongs a mile. so jefferson, evidently influenced by the advanced thinking of the metric system, had decided to stick with the measures of length that everybody already knew (i.e. the old imperial system) but had cleverly changed the unit of measure from base 12 to base 10. obviously this didn't take any more than the revolutionaries in france could make a 10-day week stick (who wanted to work 9 days to get a day off when you formerly only had to work 6!), but right in front of me was the evidence that we had tried a pseudo-metrification from the inception of the country. this brought to mind the failed metric conversion act of 1975, but until i saw this document i had no idea that we had tried this so early in our nation's history. or consider the importance of a 13-page document that lacked even the dignity of a title (the title in the quest record being the first few lines at the head of the main body of text). this document, in the house of representatives of the united states, tuesday the 8th of may, 1792 : mr. fitzsimmons, from the committee appointed to enquire into the causes of the failure of the late expedition under major general st. clair, reported, that the committee had, according to order, proceeded to examine all the papers furnished by the executive department relative thereto, sundry papers and accounts furnished by the treasury and war departments, with explanations of the same by the heads of those departments in person, to hear the testimony of witnesses upon oath, and written remarks by general st. clair \u2026 , was produced by the very first congressional investigation! the general mentioned in the title, arthur st. clair, had been tasked with subduing the native americans in the old northwest (what is now ohio, indiana, illinois, michigan, wisconsin and minnesota) and had failed miserably. the treaty of paris had ceded to the new nation all of the territory east of the mississippi river and west of the appalachians, and the united states quickly formed a legal entity called the northwest territory \u2013 the area south of the great lakes and north of the ohio river \u2013 with the goal of settlement. unfortunately, however, the people who actually resided in that territory were not represented during any of the treaty or territorial proceedings. further, though british forces had been decisively defeated at the battle of yorktown, their forces and allies in the old northwest were basically left unscathed, and british outposts remained in this area until 1815. st. clair's expedition set out in the summer of 1791 to rectify the losses suffered by general josiah harmar at the hands of one of the leaders of the western confederacy of nations, little turtle. the confederacy's goal was to keep the ohio river as the boundary between the united states and indian lands. st. clair, who was governor of the territory, had succeeded harmar as the senior general of the u.s. army. his poorly-supplied force of around 3,000 suffered straggling throughout the campaign, and when he met the combined forces of the confederacy along the wabash river in november of 1791 he was quickly surrounded. around 600 u.s. soldiers were killed, along with scores of camp followers. this battle, called the \u201cbattle of the wabash\u201d or \u201cst. clair's defeat,\u201d represented proportionally the worst defeat u.s. forces had suffered in battle in any of the indian wars. for this performance president washington sacked st. clair (who had performed credibly during the revolution), and the house of representatives decided to investigate the proceedings that had caused such a dismal defeat. this was the first such investigation by congress in history. in performing the investigation the house determined that it needed certain documents from the war department. the secretary of war, henry knox, brought this to president washington's attention, who, recognizing a major separation of powers issue, convened all of his department heads. some historians consider this to be the beginnings of the u.s. cabinet. during this and subsequent meetings washington and his advisors proposed a doctrine that the executive branch did not have to hand over papers if the public safety required them to be kept secret. this doctrine, vastly strengthened since the end of wwii due to the unprecedented destructive powers of atomic weapons, has been an issue in separation of powers cases ever since; for examples think of the issues surrounding the iran-contra affair and watergate. in the end president washington did authorize handing over the papers to the house, which essentially sided with and exonerated st. clair. these are just a few of the amazing stories to be found in this collection. the quest record for this collection is found here , and hours for the burns library can be found here . please come by to view for yourself these seminal documents in our

burns is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind outside ireland. noted early on for its strong holdings of books, pamphlets, manuscripts, newspapers, periodicals and landholding records documenting irish history and society from the late 1700's to the present, the collection in recent years has made impressive gains in the areas of literature, art (especially the book arts), music, agricultural history, and economic history. its literary collections of samuel beckett, william butler yeats and seamus heaney, for example, are ranked among the best in the world. to promote greater awareness and use of the impressive holdings, the university in 1991 established the burns library visiting scholar in irish studies chair, which is open on an annual basis to scholars who have distinguished themselves in the areas of irish history, culture, and life. see also irish music center named collections . jesuitica collection manuscripts collection listing .

stirred as much excitement and enthusiasm as the recent purchase of the first edition, first issue of newton's principia ( philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica ). over the past decade burns has made a concerted effort to bolster its collection on the history of science. it was fitting that the 2,000,000 book acquired by bc libraries in 2003 was the first edition of galileo's istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari e loro accidenti : comprese in tre lettere scritte all'illvstrissimo signor marco velseri ... / dal signor galileo galilei ... ; si aggiungono nel fine le lettere, e disquisizioni del finto apelle [christoph scheiner]. in roma: appresso giacomo mascardi, mdcxiii [1613]. this pioneering work on the subject of sun spots and inertia was a gift of wega and angelo firenze, belmont, ma, from the library of wega's father, acclaimed physicist pasquale sconzo. a number of key scientific works by copernicus, clavius, kircher, scheiner, and a third edition newton's principia have been added since the istoria , but the addition of the first edition of the principia gives the university community special reason to celebrate. burns continues to add steadily to its irish collection, already the largest and most comprehensive of its kind in the u.s., with some 60,000 volumes, more than 800,000 manuscripts, and major holdings of photographs, maps, recordings, works of art, serials, musical instruments, antique furniture, and ephemera. recent acquisitions include the addition of more than 30,000 negatives to the library's bobbie hanvey photographic negative archive. highlights of recent acquisitions include 247 negatives of poet seamus heaney speaking at the unveiling of the sculpture \"turfman\" in the village of bellaghy on april 2, 2009. among the photographs, seamus heaney is shown speaking and greeting guests, including jack graham , chairman of bellaghy development association, martin mcguinness, deputy first minister, northern ireland, and margaret ritchie, leader of sdlp. other hanvey additions include color and black & white portraits of writer john mcgahern (d. 2006) taken in and around mcgahern's home in co leitrim in the 1970s and '80s; color and black and white portraits of writer eugene mccabe taken at his home in dromard, co fermanagh, in 2005, and color and b&w portraits of the late dr. noel browne , former minister for health in the republic of ireland, taken at his home in connemara, co galway, in the 1990s. photographic negatives of poet brendan kennelly (taken in 2008) and president bill clinton (taken in 1995), along with photographic negatives of the gravesite of writer patick macgill in fall river, ma were donated to bc by hanvey, who also transferred copyright to boston college for all the images in the burns archive. to strengthen its northern ireland collection, burns also acquired \u201cthe new ulster movement\u201d archives - 1969 to 1975. brian walker, founder chair of n.u.m., describes the movement \u201cas a political catalyst in favour of solving conflict in ulster non-violently. it developed as a kind of political fabian society of protestants & roman catholics during the \u2018troubles\u2019 of the sixties & seventies. it created a presence in virtually every town & village in ulster, rigorously researched & then promoted a constant stream of political ideas & concepts (e.g. the original proposals for \u2018power-sharing\u2019, \u2018incitement to religious hatred\u2019, the development of mixed education with the teaching of irish history as its centre piece, promoted peaceful methods for solving the problem of violence endemic in ulster which were then canvassed in westminster, stormont, the dail & brussels, liaised with colleagues in the u.s.a. & wider afield, & constantly promoted the ideas of practical, political community peace & reconciliation through the media in northern ireland & further afield). n.u.m. gave birth to the alliance party which had its real successes at local government level, introducing practical methods & ideas of non-violence in the local community. n.u.m. itself continued its work of political reconciliation, in parallel to these activities.\u201d the edinburgh miscellany: a collection of the most approved scotch, english and irish songs set to music , 2 volumes (1892-1793); a collection of more than 100 samuel beckett works, many quite rare, and the nine-volume set of the recently published dictionary of irish biography , edited by james maguire and published by cambridge university press. standing orders with several irish publishers and kennys books in galway assure that the library will continue to acquire recent publications in a comprehensive manner. some fifty rare and early jesuit works have been added to the library's jesuitica collection (1540-1773) in the past few months, including a remarkable collection of 36 latin american books, including two unpublished manuscripts. of special interest are several extremely rare seventeenth century grammars and dictionaries of indian languages, including d. gonz\u00e1lez holgu\u00edn's gram\u00e1tica y arte nueva de la lengua general de todo el per\u00fa llamada lengua quichua o lengua del inca. a\u00f1adida y cumplida en todo lo que le faltaba en tiempos y de la gram\u00e1tica\u2026 vocabulario de la lengua

collection is a complete copy in its original jesuit binding of l. bertonio's libro de la vida y milagros de nuestro se\u00f1or iesu christo en dos lenguas, aymar\u00e1, y romance, traducido de el que

frightening sounding de recta sanguinis missione: or, new and exact observations of fevers. in which letting of blood is shew'd to be the true and solid basis of their cure, as well as of almost all other acute diseases . . . . on the other hand, medical advances are also evident. the database has several editions of giambattista morgagni's the seats and causes of diseases investigated by anatomy; in five books, containing a great variety of dissections . morgagni was one of the founders of modern medicine, particularly of anatomical pathology. in 1798 edward jenner, the \"father of immunology\", published in which he described inoculation with the cow-pox virus to build immunity against smallpox. many changes were also taking place in the development of law in the british empire during the 18th century. legal texts in the database that played a particularly prominent role in this development include multiple editions, abridgements, and summaries of blackstone's commentaries on the laws of england . the database also has 16 editions of richard burn's influential the justice of the peace, and parish officer . not surprisingly the turbulent 18th century is well reflected in numerous important works of political science. ecco has 20 editions of common sense , thomas paine's fervent call for american independence from britain and over 45 editions of his rights of man , a passionate attack on british political institutions and a call for radical social action. one may also read the very widely read work of the irish protestant theobald wolfe tone: catholics. an argument on behalf of the catholics of ireland. in which the present political state of that country, and the necessity of a parliamentary reform are considered (1791). there are at least 18 editions of wealth of nations , adam smith's classic argument supporting free market economics. browsing through ecco one may come across a multitude of fascinating works. for example, in 1710 was published the odd but probably useful the compleat english and french vermin-killer: being a companion for all families. shewing ready way to destroy adders, badgers, birds of all sorts, bugs, ducks, earwigs, fish, fleas, flies, foxes, frogs, gnats, lice, mice, moles, otters, pismires, polt-cats, rabits, rats, scorpions, snakes, snails, spiders, toads, wants or moles, wasps, weasles, wolf-fly, worms in houses garden, &c. with some directions for gardiners, and the prizes of workmens labour . one may read jacques andr\u00e9 naigeon' 1768's fervently atheistic, anti-christian tract le militaire philosophe ou difficult\u00e9s sur la religion propos\u00e9es au r. p. malebranche, pr\u00eatre de l'oratoire. par un ancien officier . ecco is replete with a multitude of encyclopedias, dictionaries, lexicons, catalogs, almanacs, and other reference tools. there is the full-text of the first encyclopedia britannica , published in edinburgh in three volumes in 1771. three years earlier appeared the four page proposals for printing, by subscribtion, a work, intitled, encyclop\u00e6dia britannica; or, a new and complete dictionary of arts and sciences . . . in 1777 appeared john richardson's 1148 page a dictionary, persian, arabic, and english. to which is prefixed a dissertation on the languages, literature, and manners of eastern nation . the database contains much erotica, for example the anonymous 1748 adollizing: or, a lively picture of adoll-worship. a poem in five canto's and the 1741 a court lady's curiosity; or, the virgin undress'd authored by a \"facetious florentine.\" there are 23 works with the words \"slavery\" and \"abolition\" in the title, the earliest being william dillwyn's brief considerations on slavery, and the expediency of its abolition. with some hints on the means whereby it may be gradually effected. recommended to the serious attention of all, and especially of those entrusted with the powers of legislation (new jersey, 1773). aristotle is mentioned 12,183 times in ecco whereas plato is mentioned 27,609 times., thereby beating the 27,563 occurrences of virgil. while the vast majority of ecco's titles are in english, there are also other languages represented. there's one work in the montagnais language (an algonquian dialect): nehiro-iriniui aiamihe massinahigan, shatshegutsh, mitinekaptish, iskuamiskutsh, netshekatsh, misht', assinitsh, shekutimitsh, ekuanatsh, ashuabmushuanitsh, piakuagamitsh, gaie missi missi nehiro-iriniui astshitsh ka tatjits, ka kueiasku aiamihatjits ka utshi . this contains prayers and catechisms of the catholic church. there are seven titles in irish, the earliest being the 1711 seanmora ar na priom phoncibh, na chreideamh. ar na ttarung go gaidhlig, agus ar na ccur a ccl\u00f3 a lunnduin tre ebhlin everingham , a book of sermons dealing with aspects of religion. 10 works are in manx, a goidelic language of the isle of man. the last native speaker of manx died in 1974. ecco may be used by both the advanced scholar as well the younger student. to aid the latter there are numerous contextual essays on such topics as: american independence, war of (1775-1783); deism; the enlightenment; sensibility; slavery and the slave trade; encyclop\u00e9die (denis diderot); hanoverian dynasty and many others. there is also a useful chronology, an overview of key documents in major disciplinary areas, as well as an interesting image gallery. brendan rapple collection development questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston college

scholarly communication: greater reach for research! scholarly communication , the process by which ideas are researched, developed, shared, published, accessed and preserved, is a hot topic on university campuses everywhere. librarians, as natural allies of researchers and authors, are often asked to provide answers to questions that crop up in the scholarly communication workflow. some of the questions are familiar and perennial: where should i publish? do i need permission to use that photograph in my work? others signal a revolution in scholarly publishing: should i retain rights to my published works? should i make my work openly accessible? the boston college libraries have charged a team of librarians to focus on these issues. this scholarly communication committee has recently released a new guide to copyright and scholarship . it is intended to be a resource for answering questions about copyright and scholarly communication; a one-stop-shop for basic information and a gateway to other reliable in-depth sources. separate sections of the guide deal with key concepts : copyright, public domain, fair use, author rights and open access ; processes : getting copyright, getting permission and course reserves & classroom teaching ; and types of content : electronic theses & dissertations, music & images and film & video . the guide has been reviewed by associate university counsel, nora field. copyright and fair use questions arise frequently in scholarly work. authors, as producers and consumers of information, are concerned about protecting their own intellectual property and using the works of others without infringing their rights. the issues can be complex, but the guide provides strategies for analyses and actions that preserve fair use and minimize risk to authors and the university. two important pages in the guide deal with author rights and open access. academic authors are becoming savvy about managing their intellectual property. traditionally an author, thrilled to have her article accepted in the prestigious journal in her field, signed the publisher\u2019s contract immediately, only to discover that the publisher now retained all rights to her work, limiting her ability to repurpose it and disseminate it to students and colleagues. the boston college libraries offer student and faculty authors opportunities to archive and showcase their work in the escholarship@bc repository. retaining the right to do so at the time of publication is essential. the guide provides links to standard publisher contract addenda that can help authors retain the rights required to make their work available in open access repositories. many publishers anticipate this legitimate need and no longer require exclusive rights to publication. some publishers balance their interest in recouping publishing costs with the author\u2019s desire to disseminate their ideas broadly, placing a short-term embargo on the open access archiving of the work. one website, sherpa/romeo , keeps track of these policies and enables authors to research publishers\u2019 practices in advance, eliminating the element of surprise upon receipt of the publisher\u2019s contract. this site is featured in the guide. the open access movement has been gaining momentum at an accelerating pace. the directory of open access journals lists 5514 journals and the boston college libraries currently host five open journal titles: studies in christian-jewish relations ; cities and the environment ; journal of technology, learning and assessment (jtla) ; teaching exceptional children plus ; catholic education: a journal of inquiry and practice . open access publishing allows broader and faster dissemination of ideas. it equalizes access to knowledge by eliminating economic barriers and provides authors with the satisfaction of higher citation rates. many universities have institutionalized support for open access by adopting one of the many models of open access policies for faculty publications or student theses (184, at last count by roarmap in most cases the term \u201cmandate\u201d is misleading as a label for these policies. the university claims a non-exclusive license in the work, allowing it to archive and showcase the intellectual output of the institution, while leaving the author free to publish and use his own scholarship as he sees fit. most allow authors to opt-out or delay deposit of their work if circumstances require it. boston college has not adopted an open access policy, but its intellectual property policy is linked from the guide. when federal funding is used in producing publications, mandates may be more stringent. the nih requires that articles resulting from grant-funded research be deposited in pubmed within one year of publication, and be made openly accessible. pending legislation (the federal research public access act) would require that results of research funded by grants from many federal agencies be made publically available. authors receiving grant money must manage their intellectual property in a deliberate and informed way to comply with these mandates. technologies that allow open access publishing have changed the game for authors, publishers and researchers. opportunities to self-archive can be extremely beneficial to authors and to their institutions, but a new awareness of intellectual property stewardship is essential. the copyright and scholarship guide is one resource that can help boston college authors navigate the new environment. subject liaison librarians, assigned to each department, can field basic questions and point to resources in the guide that may help. discussing work in progress with your subject liaison can ensure that a student or faculty author\u2019s work will receive the attention it deserves and will be preserved through changes in formats and technologies. please take a look at the guide and think about how you might use it. if you have questions or suggestions for additional content, please e-mail the scholarly communication committee . jane morris head, social work library learn more

myths: busted! brief definition: open-access (oa) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. what makes it possible is the internet and the consent of the author or copyright-holder. peter suber recently the libraries surveyed members of the faculty about their publishing practices. we asked some questions about open access publishing and found that, although many faculty members were receptive to the idea of publishing in open access media, a small percentage have taken advantage of these opportunities to date. many commented that they needed to know more, or were confused by the options. it\u2019s clear that misconceptions and myths about open access have found some currency, so we thought we would address a few of them here: myth: open access is a subversive movement that will ultimately undermine our copyright system. fact: open access works entirely within our current copyright system. your work as an author is copyrighted to you the moment you fix it in a tangible medium of expression (typing it into word and clicking save, for example). you retain that copyright until you give some or all of it away. traditionally, publishers\u2019 contracts required all rights to be transferred to the publisher. this is changing \u2013 publishers and authors are recognizing that it is beneficial for authors to retain some rights. copyright is often described as a bundle of rights \u2013 you can unbundle them, give some away and retain some. you might transfer to the publisher the rights necessary to publish but retain the right to deposit your work in an open access repository. myth: open access will destroy the scholarly publishing system and cause journals to fail. fact: new models are emerging in scholarly publishing. one safeguard that many journals implement is a time-limited embargo on open access. journals recoup most of the publishing costs within the first year of publication. articles can then be made open access without loss of revenue. many journal publishers have also decided to change their business model from subscription-only, cost-recovery, to a hybrid model. hybrid journals charge subscription fees, but recognize that many authors may be committed (or required) to make their publications openly available. these journals charge up-front fees ($1500-$2500 is a common range) for open access articles which appear side by side with subscription-only submissions. blackwell, brill, cambridge, kluwer, oxford, routledge, sage, taylor & francis, and wiley are among the publishers that offer hybrid journal options. many grant-funders require or support the open availability of work based on their funding, and are willing to finance these fees. many universities have established funds to pay the open access fees where no grant funding is available. myth: open access journals are not peer-reviewed and are of low quality. fact: open access journals, just like any other journal, can be peer-reviewed or not, depending on the journal policy. the fact that the journal is open access says nothing about whether it is peer-reviewed. most scholarly open access journals are peer-reviewed. in addition, in hybrid journals (where some articles are open access and some are not) the open access articles are subjected to the same review as the subscription access articles. myth: if i want to publish open access i have to submit my article to an open access journal. fact: you can submit and publish your article in any journal you like and still make it available open access in our research repository, escholarship@bc. you just need to plan for this in advance. you can send the article to escholarship at the same time that you submit it to the journal of your choice, giving bc the right to make it available (subject to an embargo period if you like). universities that have open access policies usually require this (with an opt-out safety valve for authors). or you can, at the time of signing the publishers\u2019 contract, submit a standard addendum that reserves to you the right to deposit your work in escholarship. myth: if i try to retain some rights, publishers will think i am difficult and will not want to publish my work. fact: approximately 60% of academic journals allow some form or open access archiving without any use of an addendum to the contract. for a searchable database of publisher policies about copyright and archiving, explore the sherpa/romeo site. myth: publishing my work open access is a nice, altruistic thing to do, but there is nothing in it for me. fact: open access publishing does help address inequities in access to knowledge globally. few people in the world have access to the resources we have here at boston college. but, in addition, most studies show a clear citation advantage for open access publications. open access publications are cited more often than those that are subscription-only and citation counts are still important factors in tenure and promotion decisions. for more in-depth information about open access publishing, see peter suber\u2019s excellent open access overview and take a look at our copyright and scholarship guide. please contact jane morris , scholarly communication librarian, with questions about open access or deposit in escholarship@bc. jane morris

murray, lexicographer, at work on the dictionary. the oxford english dictionary (oed) is one of those rare reference titles, a reference title that not only inspired a book on the victorian spirit that led to its creation but also a reference title that still retains its unique value in this era of easy access to reference information. like language itself, the oed continues to change and evolve, yet it still retains its primary mission, to be the \"\u2026 unsurpassed guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of 600,000 words\u2014 past and present\u2014from across the english-speaking world.\" the oed is an historical dictionary, and though you will find present day meanings of words, the focus is to detail the history of individual words, and of the language\u2014 \"traced through 3 million quotations, from classic literature and specialist periodicals to films scripts and cookery books.\" so, if you want to discover the origin of the term for the unfortunate game of beer-pong or the first use of the term faculty (in relation to your work), this is your place. what\u2019s new in this edition? historical thesaurus : a major new addition to this version of the oed is the historical thesaurus, a taxonomic classification of the majority of senses and lemmas in oed online. according to oxford, it is the first comprehensive historical thesaurus ever produced for any language, and contains almost every word in english from old english to the present day. the thesaurus has 800,000 words and meanings in 235,000 entry categories. readers and researchers can now discover synonyms for individual words in the oed (and then trace their development over time), and chart the linguistic progress of a chosen object, concept, or expression, with links to the oed definition of each new word. the thesaurus can be searched directly or one can browse its three major sections (which are further sub-divided): the external world, the mind, and society. the historical thesaurus of the oed was conceived and compiled by the english language department of the university of glasgow. the work began in 1965, resulting in a print version in 2009 and now the online version. searching updating : it almost goes without saying that one of the virtues of online access to the oed is the regular updating and additions to the database. one can sign up for an e-mail \"word of the day\" service, recently added works are noted on the home page, and you can get updates via your rss or twitter feed. there is also a monthly quote, a monthly image, and a monthly timeline (which as i write this is \"dress, fashion, and appearance\") and a monthly word cloud from the historical thesaurus. finally, you can create an account to personalize your access and save entries and searches and quality help and tutorials are readily available. so the next time some slugger accuses you of muckerism or a student attempts to fish you, and your office feels a

particularly those in the sciences, know that funding agencies, such as the national science foundation and the national institutes of health, are requiring \u201cdata management plans\u201d as part of grant proposals, while such major journals as nature, science, plosone, and american economic review, are explicitly requiring sharing of data in article submissions. this movement is an indicator of increasing concern over the long-term preservation and accessibility of the data, so much of it electronic, that underlies today\u2019s research. to learn more about these concerns, see sustainable economics for a digital planet: ensuring long-term access to digital information and, from the national academies press, ensuring the integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of research data in the digital age . contained within this preservation agenda is the increasing recognition that these, often large, data sets, which have been publicly funded, can be useful to others, and so should be shared (with careful attention to confidentiality concerns). this concept of \u201copen data\u201d is another aspect of \u201copen access\u201d. science bibliographers and others in the boston college libraries, just like those at many other major research libraries, are starting to delve into this new area of activity, building upon the long tradition of libraries engaged in organizing and preserving/archiving information, and helping others access and obtain information, including data. librarians are also developing partnerships with others across campus, such as research services, its and the office for research integrity and compliance, to provide assistance to faculty and graduate students. this new area of endeavor, often called e-science, or e-research (to convey a wider disciplinary reach), has been defined by the association of research libraries/digital library federation e-science institute (summer, fall 2011): \u2026e-research here refers to the use of information technology to support existing and new forms of scholarly research in all academic disciplines, including the humanities and social sciences. e-research encompasses computational and e-science, cyberinfrastructure and data curation. e-research projects often make use of grid computing or other advanced technologies, and are usually data intensive, but the concept also includes research performed digitally at any scale. e-research is useful here as a way to bridge the concept of e-science to other fields such as social science and the humanities. just as e-science applies large-scale computing to processing vast amounts of scientific research data, e-research could include studies of large linguistic corpuses in the humanities, or integrated social policy analyses in the social sciences. to learn more, please plan on attending \u201cgot data? the role of digital information in shaping 21st century research\u201d to hear dr. francine berman , vice president for

libraries newsletter volume 13 number 1 fall 2011 electronic theses and dissertations at boston college the most-downloaded bc dissertation . many universities across the united states have rethought their handling of graduate theses and dissertations. literature once considered hard to find and a hassle to access has been thrust into the limelight by the open access (oa) movement. at boston college, students who are about to submit their electronic thesis/dissertation (etd) to proquest are given the opportunity to make their scholarly work available online to anyone with internet access. the student does not pay for this service, and their work is available at no charge --- usually as a pdf file. as of october 2011, about 90% of bc\u2019s graduate students participate in open access (or \u201cdelayed open access\u201d, if an embargo is requested). open access has multiple benefits. the scholarship of etd authors is more visible sooner and to a wider community. once an etd has been deposited into bc\u2019s digital repository, a permanent link is assigned which the etd author can then share with colleagues or potential employers. and, thereafter, digital preservation is employed to ensure access in perpetuity. importantly, authors who agree to open access retain their copyrights. also, if they need a few years to apply for a patent or to publish articles or a book based on their etd, an embargo is easily arranged whereby the full text of their etd is not made public until the embargo expires. in keeping with bc\u2019s commitment to social justice, \u201copen access\u201d means that anyone regardless of their wealth or their privileged status has access. some authors feel a legitimate concern about making their etds available too quickly, before they have had a chance to publish their work as an article in a journal or as a book by a university press. an embargo can ensure an author has enough time to pursue these career-critical opportunities. although the choices for embargo duration listed by proquest appear to be limited to a maximum of two years, an author can insert a \u201cnote to the administrator\u201d to request an extended embargo of any duration. however, we urge authors not to ask for a \u201cpermanent\u201d embargo; otherwise no one might ever have access to the full text of their etd. a much better strategy would be to ask for the shortest embargo needed to safeguard publishing or patent opportunities. and, to ensure that other scholars will be able to find your etd via an online search, we have two recommendations. first, provide carefully chosen key words/phrases and subject categories that really capture the essence of your work. second, allow search engines to find your etd; whatever you may think of google and other search engines, for better or worse many people will employ them as part (or all) of their search strategy. finally, looking ahead, please ask yourself a question: who should be in charge of scholarship in the future\u2014publishers or those creating publishable works? in the past, the cost of publications (especially journals) has skyrocketed and authors have often had to sign away their copyrights as part of \u201cthe deal\u201d when getting published. nowadays, the open access movement is creating other options, including peer-reviewed open access journals. many authors are beginning to add creative commons licenses to their works so that other scholars can make use of their work with whatever stipulations the author deems appropriate (attribution, no commercial use, no derivative works, as a few examples). in short, we appear to be entering a new realm of opportunity whereby fewer barriers will exist to the free flow of information and our collective intellectual progress. for more details about submitting a thesis or dissertation, go to the etd@bc website or attend an etd@bc workshop\u2014they are announced each semester by the deans\u2019 offices. bill

decision-making. the center works collaboratively with business leaders and scholars in a multi-disciplinary dialogue. the ability to provide free and open access to the center\u2019s publications to our diverse constituencies, many of whom operate outside of traditional academic settings, is a key to this process. the center\u2019s goals include contributing to the scholarly examination of older adults as part of the contemporary multigenerational workforce and of the preference of today\u2019s workforce for flexible work options as important components of quality employment. the center promotes the exchange of innovative ideas about aging and work among business leaders, academics, and policy makers. we have designed our publications, virtual forums, seminars and workshops, e-communications and online resources as vehicles for sharing high quality information and stimulating discourse about the experiences of today\u2019s multi-generational workforce. the center\u2019s three strategies to promote open access web-based publications scholarly articles in academic journals the center\u2019s staff of academic researchers publishes widely in scholarly publications \u2013 peer-reviewed academic journals in such disciplines as sociology, psychology, management, and economics. we have deposited several manuscripts in our account in the bc libraries e-scholarship repository . we are currently collaborating with bc library staff to make as many publishers\u2019 pdfs, or authors\u2019 pre-prints or post-prints accessible to all, in accordance with guidelines and standards governing repository use. the aging & work facts and literature databases the center has developed two unique resources that promote access to our own publications, as well as related work by other researchers and organizations. our literature database is a publicly-accessible, searchable database of bibliographic records of articles and reports about the global multi-generational workplace. our database is an access point for subject and keyword searching of over 3300 references selected from quality academic journals, agency/organization reports, books and book chapters, including publications from the center. we provide direct links to the full-text of over 1500 publicly-available reports. for copyright-restricted sources like journal articles and book chapters, specific citation information is given to locate the items in libraries or through document delivery services. a recent enhancement is the ability to use the doi to link directly to google scholar to locate both open-access articles and journal subscriptions at the searcher\u2019s institution. our aging & work facts database provides bite-size pieces of information describing the us multi-generational workforce, based on evidence from data analysis of surveys and datasets from many sources. we select facts from openly-accessible reports published by non-profit and for-profit agencies and organizations, as well as from the center's own research. updated monthly, the database currently contains over 2700 records, each including a fact, a complete citation, and a brief study description. facts are coded with one or more aging and work topics to allow for easy searching. last year we launched an extremely popular fact of the week email message to our constituencies, highlighting timely and interesting facts from the database. we provide a direct link to the original source of each fact. our tracking shows that this approach has been effective raising awareness of open-access literature. a significant number of viewers link through to the original source publication or do further searching in our databases after receiving the fact of the week. betty cohen

number 1 fall 2011 studies in christian-jewish relations: an open access journal one of the early goals of the center for christian-jewish learning was to create a venue that would encourage ever deeper scholarship in the field. this we initially envisioned as something we could do through our website, but when we saw bc libraries announcement that they were facilitating the publication of e-journals, we quickly understood this to be an ideal opportunity. in the fall of 2005, we published the first issue of studies in christian-jewish relations as the journal of the council of centers in jewish-christian relations, an umbrella organization for mostly university based centers and institutes like ours in the united states and canada, with affiliate members from around the world. while bc libraries provides the technical, behind the scenes support for the journal, the staff of bc\u2019s center for christian-jewish learning provides the managing editor and one of the co-editors. the second co-editor and the book review editor are appointed by the council of centers. an international advisory board convenes annually at the meeting of the council of centers. there are numerous advantages to being an e-journal. we can and do now upload articles and reviews as soon as they are ready; authors need not endure an extended wait before publication. the size of any one issue is unimportant; we can include as many articles and reviews as meet our standards for quality, and we can accommodate longer articles as well. we can also (with proper permissions) embed anything that can be embedded on a web page within the article, and even in a pdf (the form in which our articles are published), our links are live. most importantly, other than those borne by the library (which are invisible to us), the expenses of publication are minimal. we do no printing and no mailing. therefore, we have no need to recover expenses through subscriptions. we can afford to be open-access, meaning that anyone who would like to learn from our publication may do so; we are freely available on the internet. there is also no delay between the publication of an article and its availability anywhere in the globe. this greatly enhances our service to our field, something that is extremely important when the participants in the contemporary dialogue are often not affiliated with university communities with ready access to expensive journals, whether in print-form or through their subscriptions to digitized archives. we have reason to believe that our readership is growing. we are certainly receiving submissions from as far away as europe and australia, and individual articles (from all issues) have been downloaded close to 8000 times in the first eight months of 2011. rabbi dr. ruth langer theology department associate director, center for christian-jewish learning questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board .

hybrid open access\u2014mixed feelings about a mixed model a welcome response to a genuine need in scholarly publication? a case of \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em?\u201d or... just another devious plot on the part of evil publishers? a hybrid open access model is becoming more prevalent among \u201ctraditional\u201d journal publishers. programs include wiley\u2019s \u201conlineopen,\u201d springer\u2019s \u201copen choice,\u201d elsevier\u2019s \u201csponsored articles\u201d and others. hybrid open access, or open access by article, is a model where an author has the choice, upon acceptance of an article, of paying upfront to make the article freely accessible to all. other articles in the journal which are not paid in advance remain behind the subscription wall. there is some dispute about whether this model deserves the name open access. as catriona maccallum points out in her 2007 plos biology article entitled \u201c when is open access not open access?\u201d , while hybrid open access articles are available to anyone with an internet connection, other aspects of open access, like the ability to repurpose works, may be prohibited. why would this model be attractive to researchers, as opposed to publishing in a true open access journal? it is a way to publish in their journal of choice and still make their work freely available. decisions on where to publish are based on factors other than cost, such as journal impact factor, prestige, scope, etc. in some cases, publication in a particular set of traditional journals is perceived as a career necessity. however, this may be changing as studies have shown open access articles have higher citation rates (see detailed bibliography http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html ). also, searching journal citation reports shows that several prominent open access journals have excellent impact factors. http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/paidoa.html .) as well as presenting some financial issues to researchers, hybrid open access articles can cause some access problems/confusion on the part of libraries and users. library electronic journal pages are most effective at identifying and providing access to entire journals, rather than individual articles. it may be difficult for the library to make access to the individual article level in a hybrid open access journal as obvious and seamless as it is to a true open access journal or a journal to which the library subscribes. this may lead the user to assume s/he cannot access this article - which is the last thing the researcher wants after paying as much as $3000 for access! it will be interesting to see how well this model works for all involved over the next few years\u2026 and also what other models will evolve to meet the need for open access. enid karr senior reference librarian/bibliographer o'neill library questions, comments?

scholarship. support for open access is increasing every year. funding agencies, academic institutions, researchers and authors have fueled exponential growth in open access scholarship. open access week (october 24-30, 2011), a global event now entering its fifth year, is an opportunity for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the benefits of oa, to share what they\u2019ve learned with colleagues, and to help make oa a new norm in scholarship and research. the boston college university libraries support open access to scholarship by educating our community about its benefits, by providing open access publishing platforms and by sparking conversation about new models of scholarly publishing. during open access week the boston college university libraries will highlight open access publishing opportunities and their benefits for researchers, authors, students and the public. here are some of the ways we hope to enhance awareness of open access at boston college, during open access week and beyond: bc libraries open access week , a new library web page, showcases video interviews with boston college oa advocates, including eight faculty

projects, including: escholarship@bc the escholarship@bc digital repository is a central online system whose goal is to showcase and preserve boston college's scholarly output. there is strong commitment to make as much as possible of the scholarship produced by the boston college community openly accessible. escholarship@bc maximizes research visibility, influence, and benefit by encouraging boston college authors to archive and distribute online both unpublished work and peer-reviewed publications in an open access environment. students depositing dissertations and theses have the choice to make their work openly accessible. open access journals the libraries use the open source open journal system software to host and provide technical support to boston college-created electronic journals . currently, there are five open access, peer-reviewed e-journals sponsored by the libraries: studies in christian-jewish relations ; journal of technology, learning and assessment (jtla) , catholic education: a journal of inquiry and practice ; fresh ink: essays from boston college\u2019s first-year writing seminar ; and lumen et vita (a graduate student journal from the school of theology and ministry). digital public library of america (dpla) the dpla is a new project intended to take the first concrete steps toward the realization of a large-scale digital public library that will make the cultural and scientific record available to all. launched in december 2010 with support from the alfred p. sloan foundation, the project grew out of a meeting which brought together over 40 representatives from foundations, research institutions, cultural organizations, government, and libraries to discuss best approaches to building a national digital library. the boston college libraries are participants in an initial beta planning project. internet archive and the open content alliance the boston college libraries contribute rare and unique content to the collections of the open content alliance. the open content alliance (oca) is a collaborative effort of a group of cultural, technology, nonprofit, and governmental organizations from around the world that help to build a permanent archive of multilingual digitized text and multimedia material. the collection of contributed material is available on the internet archive website .

department in the carroll school of management jumped on the open access movement at its inception. why did we want to become a part of escholarship and allow open access to our scholarly works ? open sharing of scholarly works promotes further research and thought, collaboration and criticism. wider distribution gets the information out there to other scholars who are influenced by the research and increases the audience for our findings, ideas and policy recommendations. open access fosters the efficient diffusion of knowledge and yields extraordinary benefits for the author, our institution, and researchers at other institutions. the documents on escholarship are word searchable and thus responsive to modern methods of online research. more readers assure that citation to the work is increased. open access allows everyone with internet access to obtain the knowledge, an appealing democratizing feature. thanks to the o\u2019neill library\u2019s escholarship project, the business law department has breached the boundaries of subscription distribution to get our work out there where more people can read it. it seems that we have come full circle from instruction to research and back again as i have included a link to the business law department\u2019s escholarship site on my classes\u2019 blackboard vista sites, giving the students fast access to publications that relate to their course work in addition to a link to the business law research guide created by sonia ensins, senior reference librarian at o\u2019neill. an added benefit to the escholarship site is that when our department was selected for academic program review this year, the link to escholarship provided a succinct and ready record of the research from our group. at the inception of the escholarship initiative at boston college, margo reder, research associate and adjunct lecturer from our department and i discussed the project with the library professionals who outlined the process to us. we were excited to be at the forefront of this new movement to distribute content of our evolving body of scholarship and preserve our life\u2019s work online. we learned it was the department\u2019s job to collect copies of our publications, obtain copyright permissions from publishers, and provide a brief abstract for each piece. as a first step, we obtained curricula vitae and actual copies of many publications from the faculty in the department. margo reder took on the permissions aspect of the project and was very successful in promoting the merits of the project to law reviews and other journals where the department had published, outlining the care that would be used in reproducing and maintaining attribution to the original publisher. she encouraged us to obtain permission at the acceptance stage on future publications in order to streamline the process and created abstracts on many dated publications where such were not readily available. the electronic resources & technical services group at o\u2019neill library manages the escholarship initiative. they were wonderful to work with and we were pleased to get to know the entire staff. betsy mckelvey acted as our primary contact and several times she hand delivered a box of processed publications to ensure that they were safely returned. the work product was meticulous; the scans look like the originals right down to the covers of the publications. they processed the publications in an orderly flow and were always available to answer questions while uploading material from the past thirty years. they also shared the digital files so that we were able to upload the publications to the social science research network which has become another online asset for legal researchers, a source that records citations and downloads that is often referenced when individuals seek promotion, tenure or hire. in the twenty years since i returned to boston college, i have found the o\u2019neill library professionals to be at the cutting edge on so many fronts. the open access project is a tremendous boost to our scholarship at boston college and signals our commitment to maintaining boston college\u2019s leadership as a premier research institution. christine neylon o\u2019brien professor and chair of business law carroll school of management questions, comments? contact the bc

"boston college libraries newsletter volume 12 number 3 spring 2011 mass observation online: the archive of a pioneering social research organization mass observation online , a fascinating searchable collection of british social history material from the mass-observation organisation (mo) established in 1937. one of mo\u2019s earliest publications may the twelfth: mass-observation day surveys 1937 documents the attitudes and reactions of a great number of ordinary people to the coronation of george vi who ascended the throne after his brother edward viii abdicated to marry the american wallis simpson. mo had anticipated that the populace would not be quite as uncritically supportive of the monarchy as the accounts depicted in the press. they were correct as the work undermined to some degree the newspapers\u2019, and indeed the government\u2019s, picture of mass approval of and enthusiasm for britain\u2019s royalty. it is an odd book with a diverse range of reactions, often idiosyncratic, to the royal family, the coronation, the abdication, and the role of the monarchy as the nation approached war. a few years later, in june 1940, another mo report, the royal family , \u201cbased on indirect questioning and the collection of a number of overheard remarks,\u201d revealed that with the onset of wwii interest in the king and queen had declined appreciably. typical of the responses was that of a middle class male aged 20 who remarked: \u201ci should think they\u2019re quite nice people, quite harmless, but redundant, -- is that the word? \u2013 unnecessary. i\u2019m not very interested in them.\u201d another observed: \u201cpeople simply aren\u2019t interested in them. they don\u2019t dislike them, or anything \u2013 they just don\u2019t think about them. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve spoken about them at the office for \u2013 oh, ever such a long time.\u201d a working woman related her disinterest specifically to the war: \u201ci think it\u2019s all a bit silly \u2013 kings and queens in wartime. i don\u2019t think they\u2019re wanted. all them things are all right in peacetime \u2013 we like to have ceremonies, and royal robes, -- but now it\u2019s up to us all \u2013 not kings and queens. that\u2019s what i think, anyway.\u201d in like manner a thirty-old laborer commented: \u201ckings and queens don\u2019t make much difference when it comes to wars and so on. ours are just figure-heads, and that shows more than ever in wartime.\u201d still, a number of observers praised the role of the royals as unifying figureheads while others acknowledged the difficulty of their jobs. some had good things to say about them as individuals. the duke of windsor is mentioned a lot but with mixed feelings. this brief 1940 report concluded that the decrease in prestige of the royal family since the outbreak of the war was partly because of the failure to exploit the symbolic value of royalty, partly because all leadership was being discredited, and partly because of antipathy to behavior of other royals, prime examples being the capitulation of king leopold and the recent unfavorable accounts provided to the british public of queen wilhelmina, princess juliana, the king of italy, and the duke of windsor. the major conclusion of the report was that many britons felt that british royalty would seek shelter abroad if the war went badly, an action that would do little to enhance their popularity: \u201cin particular, there is the feeling well based on precedent, that royalty is something different from the mass of people, and under present stresses, will slide off the top of the country into another country when things get tough.\u201d a quarter century later mass observation published the results of another major survey on british attitudes to the royal family, long to reign over us? the status of the royal family in the sixties . this revealed that though the existence of the monarchy was by and large well accepted in britain, people were not particularly interested in it nor actively advocated alternatives. \u201cthe first and most striking thing to emerge from the report is the extent to which the monarchical idea is tacitly accepted rather than actively supported. the prevalent american view of the average english as a fervid and outspoken royalist is just not true. the reaction of the average man to the monarchical idea is roughly equivalent to his reaction to the weather. he just accepts it. he grumbles about it, or praises it, but he does not expect to alter it. he certainly does not attempt to do anything about it.\u201d today, almost fifty years later, distinctly more anti-monarchical and republican sentiments are more frequently expressed in britain. it is a trend that many supporters of royalty hope the present publicity and excitement over the marriage of prince william to kate middleton will reverse. the origin of the mass observation organisation was first announced in a 30 january, 1937 letter to the new statesman and nation signed by tom harrisson, an anthropologist who had worked in borneo and the new hebrides, charles madge, poet and journalist, and humphrey jennings, a documentary film maker. the letter recommended that a new research project be established, the goal of which would be an \u201canthropology at home \u2026 a science of ourselves\u201d. accordingly, they proposed new areas of anthropological exploration of everyday life in britain including such pedestrian, and in some cases arcane, areas as \u201c behaviour of people at war memorials; shouts and gestures of motorists; the aspidistra cult; the anthropology of football pools; bathroom behavior; b eards, armpits, eyebrows; anti-semitism; distribution, diffusion and significance of the dirty joke; funerals and undertakers; female taboos about eating; the private lives of midwives.\u201d it is true that mass observation, especially in the early years, came in for copious criticism, despite the support of such luminaries as julian huxley and bronislaw malinowski, for its flawed survey and statistical techniques. nevertheless, mo\u2019s findings and publications offer fascinating analysis of britain\u2019s social, cultural and economic everyday life for the period 1937 onwards. the range of topics covered is very broad including world war ii; sex, marriage, the family, birth control; popular culture -- cinema-going, radio, music, the advent of television, sport, drinking habits; attitudes to war; political and economic views \u2013 welfare state, public health, trade unions, strikes, transport, industry, america, russia and europe, fascism, communism; social conditions and activities -- shopping, consumerism, branding, household budgeting, housing, religious practices, holidays, education, the police. particularly interesting are the personal diaries kept by ordinary men and women from 1939 onwards and which are an important component of the mo archive. the diaries covering the war years, 1939 to 1945, constitute an especially rich resource for anyone studying britons\u2019 personal experiences and feelings during a time of great turmoil. the personal accounts covering such topics as the onset of the war, public morale, the blitz, food rationing, the dunkirk evacuation, loved ones killed, post-war hope, social relations, frustrations, pastimes, love affairs and a host of other subjects are a treasure trove to the researcher of the period. in addition to the obvious interest from the coverage of an incredibly broad amalgam of subjects, mass observation -- its organization, its history, its techniques, its personalities, and so on \u2013 is itself an extraordinary social phenomenon that repays further study. caleb crain's september 11, 2006 new yorker article surveillance society: the mass-observation movement and the meaning of everyday life provides a useful overview. the \u201cessays\u201d section of the database,

libraries newsletter volume 12 number 3 spring 2011 diy electronic course packs: a free alternative to commercial products this past march, i was member of a panel presenting information about e-books at boston college\u2019s eteaching luncheon. my contribution was a summary of the library\u2019s current activity in acquiring e-books. next to me sat a sales rep for a company marketing a service which creates print and online course packs. while she was describing what sounded like a potentially useful resource, i began to think of an alternative, one that is free or, more accurately, already paid for: the library\u2019s e-book and e-journal collection. this approach could be supplemented by high quality material on the world wide web. as an example, here is a selection of texts that could provide the readings for a course on christian mysticism. not all of them are owned by the library, but could be purchased as e-books. some are free, some are purchased, and the links are either to the complete full text of the work or more information about the item. when the library purchases e-books, librarians check the purchase agreement to see if use of e-book material in course packs is permitted. cutsinger, james s. not of this world: a treasury of christian mysticism . bloomington, in: world wisdom, 2003. this volume contains selections from a number of translated primary texts.

any of the titles found in global books in print, ebrary\u2019s online catalog, or publisher\u2019s catalogs. it\u2019s still very early in the development of an e-book market, and as a result

of charles carroll. back in the fall 2010 issue of the boston college libraries newsletter i reported on a revolutionary war-era set of documents found buried deep in the bowels of the burns library . these documents, u.s. congressional reports from the first few sessions of the u.s. congress, had been in the b.c. collections for years, as they were bound together in a modern, blue library binding which sported a call number label on the spine. yet somehow this collection of books had missed retrospective conversion to machine-readable format \u2026 until last fall. so it was not completely surprising when yet another revolutionary-era document appeared on my desk. in a shipment of books from the theology and ministry library that i had been cataloging was an innocuous little octavo of but 50 pages entitled an account of washington college in the state of maryland [ image 1 ]. the item was published in philadelphia in 1784, just a year after the successful close of the american war of independence. a nice, foldout frontispiece shows a frontal view of the main hall of this college [ image 2 ]. i have to admit that i hadn't heard of washington college . i had originally thought that it might have been a predecessor of washington and lee university in nearby virginia - so i did a quick search and discovered some interesting facts. this school, near chestertown, maryland, is evidently the 10th oldest college in the country, and takes its name from one of its main benefactors, the then general washington. as you'll see, washington began supporting this school - as he did the aforesaid washington and lee university (n\u00e9e liberty hall academy) - through monetary donations and service on the school's equivalent of the board of trustees - even before the war was over [ image 3 ]. rather like the construction of the famous horse racing track in saratoga springs, new york, built at the height of the civil war, the construction of a college in the midst of our seminal armed conflict bespeaks something of the strength of this country - even in times of war. the school featured the standard liberal education of the time, heavy on the classical authors as well as math and natural philosophy, as revealed in the curriculum pages [ image 4 ]. all of the items in the burns library are - by definition - in \"special\" collections. some, however, are more special than others, and it is in this latter category that this little pamphlet falls. for on the front of the original paper covers lies a signature that is most remarkable. no, not washington's, but still that of a revolutionary hero [ image 5 ]. it's the signature of charles carroll, a signer of the declaration of independence! why, you might ask, was this item in amongst the tml's collections? virtually all of the items i've cataloged for this library relate to theology \u2013 as you might expect - in one aspect or another; so this pamphlet is really quite anomalous. the answer resides in carroll's religious affiliation - he was the only catholic to have signed the declaration ! please come to the burns and view this little piece of history for yourself, and tell the appropriate faculty of this gem that awaits their perusal. david richtmyer senior cataloger, burns library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston

newsletter volume 12 number 3 spring 2011 honors p roject in the spring of 2010, boston college honors student lauren zajac visited me at the john j. burns library and requested permission to work in the conservation lab as a part of her honors project beginning in the fall. lauren hoped to engage in a project which could further her pursuit of a career in art conservation. at first i was not certain that i could offer the level of support she would need to complete an honors project. then, remembering our library initiative to be a learning organization, i considered the possible scope of the project beyond the conservation lab. it quickly became apparent to me that i have colleagues in the library system well qualified to assist lauren as she worked on her paper. within boston college i collaborate with other departments and i felt those relationships could be very helpful to bring lauren\u2019s project to fruition. additionally, during my years in the field of conservation i have come to know experts who would be able to help as well. based on these realizations, i told lauren that she would be welcome to conduct honors work in the conservation lab. dr. gregory mcmahon, a scientist in the integrated sciences clean room and nanofabrication facility (the clean room) had visited the conservation lab earlier that spring and had indicated that he would be interested in working with me on a collaborative project. he later demonstrated the electron microscope to diana larsen of the mcmullen museum, andrew kuhn, book builder of boston intern, and me. when i approached him about lauren\u2019s request, he was immediately enthusiastic and suggested we get diana larsen on board as well. diana already had regularly worked with me on exhibitions, so she was willing to engage in this project. left: gregory mcmahon working in clean room. right: diana larsen greg, diana and i decided that lauren should focus on a damaged portrait bust of the marquis de la fayette, possibly by french sculptor jean-antoine houdon (1741-1828) now in the custody of the mcmullen museum. this would afford her the opportunity to conduct an art history investigation, learn about conservation issues, and execute material analysis. dr. mcmahon acted as lauren\u2019s official advisor and helped her conduct materials analysis in the clean room. he also enlisted the help of dr. natasha erdman, from electron microscope manufacturer jeol usa, to conduct additional testing. diana larsen, at the mcmullen museum, graciously allowed lauren access to the records pertaining to the bust. ms. larsen quickly involved more outside museum experts in the project, including anne poulet, director of the frick collection, and arthur beale, former chief conservator at the museum of fine arts. both of these experts have deep knowledge houdon\u2019s work. enid karr, justine hyland, adeane bregman, lauren zajac, barbara hebard lauren also received research assistance from boston college librarians. adeane bregman, art librarian, was very helpful in unearthing art reference materials. enid karr, reference librarian/science bibliographer, already familiar with the electron microscope, helped lauren locate pertinent science periodicals. and justine sundaram, reference librarian, helped with materials at the burns library. all had valuable advice for her paper. by coming to the libraries for help, lauren received more than just one advisor: we became a resource team. i took lauren and diana on a field trip to the boston athenaeum to view that institution\u2019s houdon la fayette portrait bust. while at the athenaeum, we consulted with associate curator of paintings and sculpture hina hirayama regarding eighteenth and nineteenth century sculpture techniques. lauren was permitted to use rare materials for research from the athenaeum\u2019s collection on that trip, as well. later, while investigating a possible white house connection to the portrait bust, we visited the kennedy library and were helped by archivist stephen plotkin. afterwards, many conservators came up to me to congratulate me on having such a fine intern. they also expressed envy that i was able to collaborate with other departments in the project, readily understanding that it made the project more exciting for lauren and gave me an opportunity to learn along with her. the conservators also were interested in the ease with which the collaboration occurred. lauren\u2019s intern presentation and her honors project, an sem and microanalysis examination of a marquis de lafayette terracotta portrait bust , were wonderful personal accomplishments for her and had the added value of bringing renown and attention to boston college collections, the libraries, and the clean room. upon graduation, she will be working full time as a research assistant at new york university. our reputation is shining brighter because of her determination and talent. barbara adams hebard conservator,

the tapestry entitled merito vapulat aper which had been hanging in the ford tower of the john j. burns library was carefully taken down. the 17th century flemish silk and wool textile was removed for two reasons: first, historic textiles should be hung for limited periods of time for structural stability and, second, the fa\u00e7ade of the bapst building and parts of the ford tower were scheduled to undergo construction work june through august. merito vapulat aper is from a series of seven tapestries narrating the story of venus and adonis. boston college also owns three tapestries depicting scenes from the life of caesar. all the tapestries were given by the hearst foundation in honor of william randolph hearst in 1988. european-style tapestries are large decorative wall hangings woven by hand in a tapestry weave, often consisting of a central field and borders. the word \u201ctapestry\u201d actually refers to the weaving technique, not a particular type of textile. tapestries took years to complete and required highly skilled workers to execute the labor-intensive process. in order to hang properly with ample support, historic tapestries need a velcro hanging system and proper lining. the hanging system in place at the burns library was created by textile conservator camille myers breeze, the expert who oversaw the june 3rd take-down. ms. breeze is the director of museum textile services, a company which provides conservation and collections care to museums, historical societies and private collectors. before becoming director of museum textile services, breeze, an internationally known conservator, worked for the textile conservation center at the american textile history museum, in lowell, massachusetts. the author of a book on american tapestry conservation

boston college is following a long tradition of tapestry exhibition: in the past tapestries were status symbols subjected to many moves. european royalty, owners of multiple tapestries, enjoyed rotating the display of these treasures and, when travelling, frequently had the tapestries packed to accompany them. the burns library proudly has continued this custom: the tapestries given in honor of william randolph hearst are rotated on a regular basis, thus affording the boston college community an opportunity to admire these generous gifts from the hearst foundation. barbara adams hebard

volume 12 number 2 winter 2010 charles evans and early american imprints in 1998 edward gorey told the boston globe : \"i thought i'd be a librarian until i met some crazy ones.\" while i'm not sure that there's a higher incidence of craziness among librarians than among other professions, i've no doubt that some very singular and even fractious individuals are employed in librarianship. not at bc, of course! certainly, a particularly difficult librarian to work with, judging from his firings from numerous libraries, was charles evans who along with melvil dewey, creator of the dewey decimal classification system, were the first two members of the american library association. there is little doubt that evans was a challenging work colleague who was responsible for friction in most libraries in which he worked. in 1878 he was dismissed as librarian from indianapolis's public library due to antagonistic relationships with the library staff. in 1886 he was asked to resign from the enoch pratt free library, baltimore. a year later he was discharged from the omaha public library. then after taking up duties once more at indianapolis public library, evans was again dismissed in 1892. in 1895 he was fired from chicago's newberry library. six years later he was fired as librarian from the chicago historical society due to turbulent relations with his superiors. this was his last spell working in a library. yet in 1955 renowned bibliographer clarence brigham termed evans, who had little formal education, \"a great american scholar whose career is one of the most outstanding of modern times\" and declared that his american bibliography was \"one of the greatest bibliographical compilations of all time.\" brigham was referring to evan's great work, a compilation of an annotated bibliography of all works published in the us to the year 1820. this was entitled the american bibliography: a chronological dictionary of all books, pamphlets and periodical publications printed in the united states of america from the genesis of printing in 1639 down to and including the year 1820, with bibliographical and biographical notes. though evans's died before the bibliography's completion, he did succeed in bringing it up to the year 1800. most research libraries, including o'neill library, contain the 14 volumes of evans's monumental bibliography. however, bc libraries also has the online full-text version, early american imprints, series i: evans, 1639-1800 . based on evans' american bibliography and roger bristol's supplement, this database, commonly termed evans i , contains the full-text of practically every book, pamphlet and broadside published in america up to the year 1800. the content includes advertisements, almanacs, bibles, broadsides, catalogs, charters, by-laws, contracts, state papers, presidential letters, congressional, state and territorial resolutions, cookbooks, elegies, eulogies, laws, maps, narratives, novels, operas, pamphlets, plays, poems, primers, sermons, songs, speeches, textbooks, tracts, travelogues, treaties, works of many european authors reprinted for the american public, among other materials. there are numerous options for searching the database. the primary ones are genre, subjects, author, history of printing, place of publication, and language. there are about ninety headings under genre, including \"academic dissertations,\" \"burlesques,\" \"hieroglyphic bibles,\" \"novels,\" \"rebuses,\" \"treaties,\" and many others. one may also search by subject, the primary ones being \"economics and trade,\" \"government,\" \"health,\" \"history,\" \"labor,\" \"languages,\" \"law and crime,\" \"literature,\" \"military,\" \"peoples,\" \"philosophy,\" \"politics,\" \"religion,\" \"science and technology,\" \"society, manners and customs,\" and \"theology.\" each of these main subjects is also subdivided into numerous others. the contents of evans i are also searchable by language, those represented being algonquian, dutch, english, french, german, ancient greek, latin, mohawk, spanish, swedish, welsh. it's impossible in this short article other than to hint at the incredible riches that this database provides. we can access the first edition of william hill brown's the power of sympathy: or, the triumph of nature. founded in truth . published in boston in 1789 by isaiah thomas, this two volume epistolary work about tragic, incestuous love is generally considered the first american novel. the database contains numerous works pertaining to slavery and the slave trade. the advertisements for upcoming slave auctions are especially chilling. for example, there's the notice from charlestown dated april 27, 1769: to be sold, on wednesday the tenth day of may next, a choice cargo of two hundred & fifty negroes: arrived in the ship countess of sussex, thomas davies, master, directly from gambia, by john chapman, & co . slave ownership and the slave trade were extremely prevalent in new york in the early 18th century. still shaken by the 1712 new york city slave revolt, the authorities of that city in 1731 passed a law for regulating negroes and slaves in the night time . if slaves broke the law, penalties were severe: and be it further ordained by the authority aforesaid, that every slave or slaves that shall be convicted of the offence aforesaid, before he, she or they be discharged out of custody, shall be whipped at the publick whipping post (not exceeding forty lashes) if desired by the master or owner of such slave or slaves. in 1692, deodat lawson, a former minister of salem village, published a firsthand account of the witchcraft proceedings he had witnessed in march and april of that year in salem: a brief and true narrative of some remarkable passages relating to sundry persons afflicted by witchcraft, in salem village: which happened from the nineteenth of march, to the fifth of april, 1692 . undoubtedly relevant to today's political climate are the database's documents pertaining to the boston tea party of 1773. perhaps the song, tea: destroyed by indians , if recorded by the right individual(s) would have a chance of being included in today's hit parade. one of the stanzas goes as follows: our liberty, and life is now invaded, and freedom's brightest charms are darkly shaded: but, we will stand----and think it noble mirth, to dart the man that dare oppress the earth. three years earlier in 1770 occurred the boston massacre when british soldiers shot into a crowd of demonstrating boston citizens. the following poem memorializes the shootings: a poem, in memory of the (never to be forgotten) fifth of march, 1770. on the evening of which, a party of the 29th. regiment commanded by capt. preston, fired upon the inhabitants in king-street, by which five persons were killed viz. samuel gray, samuel maverick, james caldwell, crispus attucks, and patrick carr . if space permitted, i could easily continue selecting resources from evans i . much better, however, is if you dip into the database yourself. evans i is one of the three full-text databases composing the portal america's historical imprints which is owned by bc libraries. the other two are early american imprints, series ii: shaw-shoemaker, 1801-1819 and american broadsides and ephemera, series i, 1760-1900 . evans i ends with the year 1800. american publications from the first nineteen years of the 19th century are covered in early american imprints, series ii which is based on ralph r. shaw's and richard h. shoemaker's american bibliography, 1801-1819 . evans i and early american imprints, series ii combined amount to well over six million pages. american broadsides and ephemera, series i, 1760-1900 , the third database making up america's histo rical imprints, has about 15,000 broadsides printed between 1820 and 1900 and 15,000 pieces of ephemera printed between 1760 and 1900. the range of material is vast and includes tax bills, town meeting reports, song lyrics, advertisements for the theatre and musical programs, cartoons, temperance movement documentation, trading cards, restaurant menus, notices of slave auctions, stock certificates, campaign literature, publishers' prospectuses, dying confessions of convicted criminals, billheads, invitations, clipper ship sailing cards, civil war envelopes among numerous other types of material. brendan rapple collection development librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter

college libraries newsletter volume 12 number 2 winter 2010 focus on publishing: brepols - a vital partner in humanities scholarship founded in 1796, brepols publishers is located in a 17th century beguinage in turnhout, belgium. during the medieval and early modern period, beguinages housed beguines or women living together in a semi-monastic community but without formal vows. the peak of beguine activity was during the middle ages, and therefore a beguinage is a fitting home for a publisher which specializes in medieval texts and scholarship. a browse through the areas of expertise of brepols' editorial staff provides a good picture of the subject strengths of this independent publishing house: theology, philosophy, history, archaeology , language, literature, music, art, and architectural history. over the past sixty years, o'neill library has continued to collect the print version of brepols' major publishing series of critical texts, the corpus christianorum in its many subseries, which to date numbers nearly 500 volumes. in 1991, this series appeared for the first time in digital format as the cetedoc library of christian latin texts or clclt and was distributed on cd-roms. by 2005, this resource was available on the web and its content had expanded to include latin texts from the pre-christian to the modern period. today, the library of latin texts contains 63 million latin words, drawn from more than 3,200 works that are attributed to approximately 950 authors. it should be noted that the digital division of brepols publishers is named brepolis . the choice of brepolis, which is sometimes rendered as brepolis, was probably influenced by the use of the lower case \"i\" at the beginning of so many digital products (most famously the ipod) \u2013 but with a clever twist worthy of a publishing house staffed by classicists and medievalists: the \"i\" is hidden in a name which sounds like an ancient greek city. the boston college libraries' extensive holdings of brepols' print publications are now complemented by a number of brepolis web resources. in addition to the library of latin texts , researchers can access the following: the bibliography of british and irish history provides bibliographic data on historical writing that deals with the british isles, the british empire and commonwealth, the republic of ireland, and the irish in america. date of coverage ranges from 55bc to the present. in principio consists of a collection of one million incipits (the first words of a particular ancient or medieval manuscript), the product of research carried out by the institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes and the hill monastic manuscript library. vetus latina database : the latin biblical texts which were in existence from the second century ce until the time when the vulgate became predominant are known as the vetus latina, or the old latin, bible. the term vetus latina refers to all those biblical texts translated into latin which are not found in the vulgate. international medieval bibliography is a comprehensive and current bibliography of the european middle ages (c.450-1500) of articles in journals and miscellaneous volumes of conference proceedings, essay collections and festschriften. aristoteles latinus database coming next semester: bibliographie de civilisation m\u00e9di\u00e9vale database of

libraries newsletter volume 12 number 2 winter 2010 e-books in the boston college libraries the new york times , along with many other news outlets, has predicted e-books are increasingly recognized as having certain important benefits over print books: for reference use (for encyclopedic information, data and other facts); for multi-authored books, where the individual chapter is the segment of interest, and where the user would be unlikely to read from cover-to-cover; and for monographs, where multimedia can greatly enhance the experience and the information conveyed (by inclusion of audio or video clips, etc.) e-books also have the great advantage of offering remote access \u2013 at any time of day. the libraries are careful in their selection of e-book products, with relevant content being uppermost, and preference given to products offering the following licensing terms: purchase (rather than subscription, with its attendant on-going costs); favorable digital rights management (ensuring that the license provides users the ability to print/download meaningful segments of a title, i.e. not limited to page-by-page printing, according to fair use guidelines of u.s. copyright law; and provisions for perpetual access. third-party agents, such as portico , are now working with many major publishers to preserve e-book content, an option previously limited to e-journal content. in the past, purchasing options for libraries were largely limited to e-book collections where libraries had little or no choice but to purchase desired as well as less-desirable titles. in more recent years, however, publishers and vendors have responded to the need for individual selection to meet the needs of a specific community, and options for granular title purchase selection have now appeared. the boston college libraries have contracted with ebrary for this type of individual title selection, and are purchasing more titles in this way, while continuing to purchase important publisher collections, where appropriate. in the sciences, the major scientific, technical, and medical (stm) publishers have moved aggressively into e-books, introducing some innovative business models, with many adhering to all of the guidelines described just above. elsevier publishing, for example, now offers the product, \u201cevidence-based selection\u201d, providing access to selected, full e-book collections for a 12-month period. at the end of that time, libraries can invest that cost in purchasing individual titles either from that collection or from others, but now with the benefit of knowledge of individual use history. in response to growing interest in this subject from many sectors, the boston college libraries have purchased access to the elsevier \u201cebs\u201d collection for environmental studies books pre-2007 through 2009. the scholarly e-book market is stepping more slowly into the e-reader fray. all e-book publishers provide documents in pdf (portable document format), useable on computers. however, many show ambivalence at this time about providing the ability to download content into e-book readers; that is changing, but slowly. despite this slow start in academia, as the new york times article indicated, e-readers are growing in popularity. for boston college users ready to try out an e-reader, there are ten apple ipads now available for loan at the o\u2019neill library circulation desk. additional ipads will be available soon at other boston college libraries. sally wyman collection development librarian, o'neill library questions,

december 1, i became the new scholarly communication librarian at boston college. when i announce this to colleagues and faculty, a perplexed look often crosses their faces. i suspect they are thinking: what is that? what will she be doing? why do we need one? my new position will involve working with faculty, administration and students across the university to facilitate, harvest and showcase the intellectual output of boston college. the libraries\u2019 new strategic plan articulates this goal: the libraries create and maintain a unified and distinguished digital library of institutional assets to enhance the reputation of the university and to support users\u2019 research and scholarship. key strategies to reach the goal include converting unique holdings in special collections to digital formats; collecting, preserving and making as openly accessible as possible the publications and research data of faculty and research centers; providing campus leadership and expertise in e-publishing initiatives; and facilitating state-of-the-art digital scholarship and innovation by boston college faculty and students. some of this work has already begun. the libraries manage a research repository for digital work, called escholarship@boston college . most boston college theses and dissertations are deposited there and made discoverable and accessible. some faculty deposit articles or books they have authored. the libraries host five open-access, peer-reviewed journals; the newest is catholic education: a journal of inquiry and practice . several new high-profile digitized collections have been made available, including the striking bobbie hanvey photographic archives . and we are currently working on our first project to archive and make accessible faculty research data with all of the associated publications. i plan to begin my efforts by teaming up with the subject liaison librarians who work closely with the faculty in the academic departments. we will do a comprehensive scan to determine community needs for a repository to house scholarship and for digital display and broad dissemination. we want to discover the unmet needs for deposit, preservation and access, and then create a world-class repository to meet those needs. we will be approaching faculty with such questions as: would your department or program like to publish an open access journal? where are you publishing now? are you an editor of a scholarly journal? what are the journal\u2019s policies on access to articles? do you have research data on your hard drive that should be preserved? do you want to make your scholarship available to the world without economic barriers? once we have a firm sense of the needs of the community, we will be able to create a program with infrastructure and allied services that make stewardship of university output and resources a priority. our goal will be to provide services that make this process seamless for faculty and gain the greatest possible impact for university scholarship. as the scholarly communication librarian i will also serve as an initial point person for intellectual property issues that commonly arise in digitization projects, research repositories and day-to-day scholarly work. i have worked on copyright issues in libraries for several years and have a law degree from boston university. my role will be to spot the questions that can be easily resolved and to refer others to university counsel. our scholarly communication committee has recently created a research guide on copyright and scholarship to provide basic resources on copyright, author rights and open access. i hope to help boston college participate in the regional and national academic conversations on open access to scholarship. this is an important and lively debate that will affect future access to publications and the creation of new knowledge. many universities have new open access policies and some grant-funders have open access requirements, with more in the proposal stage. as enid karr states in her article in this newsletter, the boston college libraries have long supported open access initiatives in the sciences. my job will be to facilitate conversations about the benefits of open access for authors and researchers on the boston college campus. if you have questions about escholarship, a place to deposit your work, an intellectual property issue or open access, please contact me at jane.morris@bc.edu or at 617 552-4481. i look forward to meeting you on january 20. jane

leader in promoting open access publishing in the sciences the combined effect of increases in the cost of academic journals outpacing increases in library budgets along with the potential to challenge traditional publishing business models with the growth and acceptance of electronic journals has led to the development of thousands of open access journals in recent years. see, for example, the directory of open access journals . there are several business models for covering the costs of producing the journals, including library/institutional sponsorships and publication charges supported by researcher\u2019s grant money, as well as hybrid models. all of these models depend on the support of the library community to remain robust. with open access, access to scholarly journals is available to anyone freely over the internet. open access helps to lower barriers to education, research and scholarship, providing vital information to countries, institutions, and individuals regardless of their wealth. as a catholic, jesuit university committed to social justice, boston college has been a leader in support of these initiatives. boston college is a signer of budapest open access initiative (boai) and of the alliance for taxpayer access . open access is perhaps particularly valuable in the sciences. the earliest mandates for making taxpayer-funded research available have been by funding agencies in this area. open access has been shown to increase both the visibility and citability of articles, which is of high importance to scientists. many open access journals are peer reviewed. ongoing relationships between boston college libraries and oa publishers and consortia in the sciences currently include: plos (public library of science) boston college is an institutional member. according to thomsen reuter, plos biology has the highest impact factor of any journal in the category of biology, and by a huge margin. through our membership, boston college researchers get a 10% publication discount. arxiv arxiv, a pre-print server in the physical sciences and beyond (math, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology and statistics), is one of the earliest and most successful efforts of the open access movement. as a supporting institution, boston college now provides financial help for this important publishing medium. scoap3 (sponsoring consortium for open access publishing in particle physics) scoap3, a consortium made up of high-energy physics (hep) funding agencies, hep laboratories, and leading national and international libraries and library consortia, is working with publishers to develop a new business model supporting conversion of five traditionally-published core hep journals into open access titles; these five will serve as models for the wider hep journal publishing environment. boston college has submitted an \u201cexpression of interest\u201d to be a part of this ambitious undertaking. biomed central biomed central has a large roster of open access journals in a wide range of topics. boston college is a sponsor member, which gives our researchers a 15% discount on publication costs.

fall 2009 the open comprehensive digital library: a vision imperiled the library of alexandria , the most famous library of antiquity, continues to capture our imagination. the sense of romance evoked by a library containing all of the world's knowledge is heightened by sense of loss evoked by the library's destruction. in an age in which we rely on internet to meet our information needs, it seems possible to recapture and even improve upon the alexandrian ideal. while access to the ancient library was limited by geography and privilege, a digital reincarnation could be accessible anywhere to anyone with a mobile device. unfortunately, the vision of an open and comprehensive digital library will not be easily realized; great achievements often require a struggle. while technological barriers have been rolled back, restrictive copyright laws and outdated business models continue to pose significant obstacles. copyright and digital libraries effective copyright laws promote innovation and creativity by allowing authors to reap financial rewards for their work. consequently, the copyright promotes the public good. the writers of the u.s. constitution recognized this by granting congress the power \u201cto promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\u201d the first u.s. copyright act, passed in 1790 , remained true to the spirit of the constitution providing a limited copyright term of fourteen years, renewable for another fourteen years. the law\u2019s requirement for registration and renewal of copyright provided a paper trail which facilitated copyright research and verification. unfortunately, copyright has become an obstacle to digital library building. in the past four decades, congress has dramatically increased the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the author. copyright has also become automatic; registration, renewal, and explicit copyright statements are no longer required. the length of the copyright term dramatically limits the body of works available for digitization. the elimination of any registration or renewal process makes it difficult to find rights-holders. the removal of the requirement for an explicit copyright statement means that a work an author may have intended to share freely must be considered to be under copyright restrictions. on a practical level, the effect is to make mass digitization of books published from 1923 to the present a practical impossibility. copyright laws, intended to promote the public good, have become so restrictive that they detract from the public good. business models and digital library ethics american brick and mortar libraries, especially in the academic and public sectors, have built mature collections and developed strong traditions around democratic access and privacy protection. the absence of a large-scale, publicly funded national digital library program leaves a vacuum in which library values and infrastructure are being defined on an ad hoc basis by non-profit and corporate initiatives. non-profit initiatives in the non-profit arena, a plethora of cultural heritage institutions, research libraries, and charitable organizations have demonstrated their belief in the alexandrian ideal by creating open digital collections. project gutenberg, founded in 1971, is one of the oldest efforts. the project has a catalog of almost 30,000 online books, is registered with the irs as a charity, and recruits volunteer proofreaders. the university libraries of boston college does its part by supporting an active program to digitize library collections and by supporting escholarship@bc, an open access repository for the scholarly output of the university. pursuing the ideal at boston college the university libraries support a number of open digital initiatives. ongoing digitization projects include the bobbie hanvey photographic archives, the sacred heart review, and the the robert e. brooker iii collection of american legal and land use documents. for collections, see the digital collections page. the library hosts an institutional repository, escholarship@bc , to provide open access to the scholarly output of the university. faculty publications, graduate theses and dissertations, undergraduate honors theses, and the publications of centers and research units are included in the repository. the escholarship@bc program also supports the publication of four open access journals: cities and the environment the journal of technology, learning and assessment studies in christian-jewish relations teaching exceptional children plus building the comprehensive digital library \"accidentally\" by using commercial search engines to retrieve content from independent non-profit digital initiatives is appealing on some level. it avoids the challenges of governing and financing a large scale enterprise and eliminates the risk of placing too much power in the hands of a few. the accidental digital library, however, falls short on many fronts. without a coordinated collection development strategy determining what is added to and removed from the collection, the scope of the collection is capricious. the library\u2019s comprehensiveness and its stability are uncertain. further, reliance on commercial search engines as the only discovery tool for the comprehensive digital library is problematic. privacy is jeopardized. research endeavors are influenced by search algorithms designed to generate advertising revenue. e-commerce sites are included in search results. traditional library catalogs are designed to give similar works on the same topic an equal chance of retrieval. such even-handedness cannot be expected from commercial search engines. when revenue is at stake and no standards apply, the incentive is to build a site to maximize the chance of retrieval. non profit digital library initiatives globe article ) american memory : 9 million items from the collections at the library of congress that document u.s. history and culture, including manuscripts, prints, photographs, posters, maps, sound recordings, motion pictures, books, pamphlets, and sheet music. the edgar allan poe digital collection : the ransom center, the university of texas at austin at the heart of the archive\u2019s collection building activities are the 20 regional scanning centers it supports in five countries. at these scanning centers, one of which is at the boston public library, 1,000 public domain books from collaborating libraries, including our own university libraries, are digitized each day. the non-profit scanning centers are highly efficient; the cost to collaborating libraries is only 10 cents per page to have a book scanned and made available online. boston college/internet archive collaboration turns to irish materials in the past several months, irish history has been the focus of the boston college/internet archive collaboration. 550 books from the fifth floor of o\u2019neill have been scanned at internet archive\u2019s regional scanning center at the boston public library. this latest effort brings the number of boston college volumes in the internet archive to 775. our earlier contributions to the archive include jesuitana and medieval philosophy texts. our digital texts at the internet archive are cataloged in quest. the entire collection can be viewed on the archive\u2019s books from boston college page. digital library building is an expensive proposition, requiring significant investments in staff, technology, and copyright research. as a result, the corpus of works available through non-profit digital libraries is still relatively small compared to the body of all books ever published. in the absence of a large scale publicly funded effort, we have a digital library vacuum which, if filled exclusively by the private sector, will fundamentally alter the understanding of what it means to be an american library. for profit initiatives in 2002, google launched a secret \"books\" project with the goal of scanning every book in the world. not only did google have the technological and financial means to pursue such an ambitious goal, google\u2019s founders viewed digital library building as essential to their business strategy. google\u2019s founder sergey brin explained this synergy in a 2007 interview for a new yorker article, google\u2019s moon shot : we really care about the comprehensiveness of a search. and comprehensiveness isn\u2019t just about, you know, total number of words or bytes, or whatnot. but it\u2019s about having the really high-quality information. you have thousands of years of human knowledge, and probably the highest-quality knowledge is captured in books. so not having that\u2014it\u2019s just too big an omission. in 2004, google began approaching major research libraries, offering to scan their collections in exchange for providing the library with digital copies of their collections. in july 2004, a pilot project was initiated to scan the 7 million volume collection at the university of michigan. as of 2007, google estimated there is no doubt that google search\u2019s inclusion of texts from the world\u2019s great libraries provides a public benefit. it is not, however, a substitute for libraries as we have come to know them: user privacy is not guaranteed, search results could be shaped to maximize advertising revenue, and there is no guarantee that the access to the books will remain free in perpetuity. this is wholly appropriate, for, after all, google\u2019s primary obligation as a public company is to maximize shareholder value, not to build free digital libraries for the common good. copyright, again all was well with the google books project until restrictive copyright laws put into motion a series of unfortunate events that threaten to destroy the alexandrian ideal. as stated earlier, the recent increases in the length of the copyright term and the challenges of identifying copyright holders make it impractical for digital library initiatives to make available the vast majority of books published after 1923. google, however, took a risk and invested heavily in digitizing post-1923 books. in april 2009, an estimated 6 million of the 7 million books that google had digitized were still in copyright. of the 6 million digitized and in-copyright books, paula samuelson, a professor at the uc berkeley school of law, estimates that 70 percent are out of print. this vast corpus of in-copyright, out-of-print books \u2013 a significant portion of the written record of the 20th century \u2013 is at the heart of the copyright problem. prof. samuelson explains in an acm article : most of them are, for all practical purposes, \"orphan works,\" that is, works for which it is virtually impossible to locate the appropriate rights holders to ask for permission to digitize them. a broad consensus exists about the desirability of making orphan works more widely available. yet, without a safe harbor against possible infringement lawsuits, digitization projects pose significant copyright risks. google\u2019s risk was, not surprisingly, rewarded with a class action infringement lawsuit. in 2005, the association of american publishers and the author\u2019s guild responded by filing suit against google for copyright violation. despite the lawsuit, google maintains that the manner in which it uses copyrighted books is legal and benefits copyright holders by including their works in its search results: . . . some in the publishing community question whether any third party should be able to copy and index copyrighted works so that users can search through them, even if all a user sees is the bibliographic information and a few snippets of text, and even if the result is to make those books widely discoverable online and help the authors and publishers sell more of them. copyright law is supposed to ensure that authors and publishers have an incentive to create new work, not stop people from finding out that the work exists. by helping people find books, we believe we can increase the incentive to publish them. after all, if a book isn't discovered, it won't be bought. however, rather than risk a court ruling that jeopardized its enormous digitization investment, google negotiated a settlement with its plaintiffs in october 2008. the settlement is subject to approval in united states district court for the southern district of new york following a final fairness hearing. the fairness hearing was scheduled for earlier this month. however, concerns about the settlement are so widespread that the fairness hearing has been postponed in order to amend the settlement. the primary problems with the settlement are as follows: the settlement addresses obstacles in the copyright law which should be addressed by the legislative branch rather than the judicial system. the settlement effectively gives google a monopoly over the corpus of in-copyright but out of print books by granting google the right to determine whether or not a book is commercially available, the right to sell copies of books which are not commercially available, and a \"safe harbor\" against infringement lawsuits should it make a mistake in its determinations. a proposed non-profit book rights registry, which would be established to address the absence of copyright registration and renewal requirements in the current copyright law, would have a bias towards google. the registry is to be established with financial and technological assistance from google. its purpose is to allow copyright holders to register their rights. registered rights holders could opt to have their books removed from google\u2019s corpus or to receive financial compensation for google\u2019s use of the book. while others would be able to consult the registry, the settlement manifests a clear google bias, stating that the registry \"will respond in a timely manner to requests by google.\" the plaintiffs in the suit are not diverse enough to be representative of all authors and publishers. an amended settlement which may very well determine our digital future is due to be filed with the court on november 9. advocates of the alexandrian ideal can monitor new developments at the public index and the google book settlement site which is maintained by the settlement administrator with technical support from google. betsy mckelvey o'neill library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board .", "hrefTitle": "The Open Comprehensive Digital

theses & dissertations the online system for submitting electronic theses and dissertations at boston college, etd@bc , has now been used successfully by well over a hundred graduate students; their feedback has been quite positive. etd@bc consists of two parts: first, the student is asked whether they want their document to be posted on bc\u2019s institutional repository ; second, the student goes to a proquest website where they submit a pdf of their thesis (or dissertation) along with some descriptive key words and related information, and they make a number of decisions about which proquest services they desire. for more than 90% of these submissions, students have availed themselves of the open access (oa) service that is provided by the libraries of boston college. by agreeing to oa, students request that their scholarly work be posted on bc\u2019s institutional repository where it can be accessed for free by anyone who has an internet connection. the author, i.e. the student, retains copyright to the work. if there is a need to delay access for a specified period of time, an \"embargo\" option exists. for example, if the author or his faculty advisor needs time to apply for a patent, or if there is a need to protect proprietary or confidential information, or if the author plans to submit their dissertation \"as is\" to a book publisher who proscribes any prior disclosure, then the student can specify an embargo of six months, one year, two years, or even longer. during the embargo period, the dissertation title, the author\u2019s name, the school affiliation, keywords, and abstract are visible to the public. at the end of the embargo period, the full text of the dissertation becomes available online as well. given this opportunity to disseminate one\u2019s research rapidly and freely to a very broad audience, what issues should a graduate student ponder before deciding about oa? why should i? in conducting your own research, you have probably been able to discover and access scholarly work without paying any fees. in many cases, boston college has already paid for an institutional subscription, as it does for the proquest dissertations & theses database, thereby making it seem like your access is \"free\". in other cases, it is because the article has been published in a peer-reviewed open access journal \u2014 many examples can be found at the directory of open access journals website . your opting for open access will promote free exchange of ideas within the scholarly community; it will also have a social justice benefit, viz. much of the world can not afford to pay for access to knowledge and will depend entirely upon open access. will the online availability of my dissertation jeopardize its publishability? it depends. articles based on doctoral research are usually so different from the dissertations from which they originated that they are essentially new works --- \"prior publication\" would not apply, so publishers would have no reason to be concerned that they are publishing something that is already available for free. for books based on dissertations, it may be that there have been extensive revisions that would again make the book essentially a new and different work. nevertheless, some publishers may be reluctant to publish such books if the dissertation is available for free. in fact, even if a dissertation has been made available by proquest on a cost per download basis, some publishers may balk; so it is incumbent on each author to be familiar with prospective publishers\u2019 policies. what if i forego open access \u2014 won't my dissertation still be available online through proquest? eventually, after any embargo that you have specified expires, proquest will make the full-text of your thesis available online on a pay-per-download basis. however, you can specify during the submission that you need an extra long embargo (more than two years), even a permanent embargo. this is done by inserting such a request as a \"note to the administrator\" which in turn becomes an \"administrator note\" to proquest so that they are informed as to special requests. that said, we expect that the need for extremely long embargos will be quite rare. can i make my dissertation available via open access but not allow it to be found using search engines such as google? yes, during the online submission, you will have the option of requesting \"no search engine access.\" in effect, the \"metadata\" describing your thesis that enable it to be discovered by an online search are not shared with search engine companies. scholars could still find your dissertation by searching the boston college repository. and, in the future, there will be a \"networked digital library of theses and dissertations\" with which scholars will be able to search repositories throughout the world for theses, but access will still be provided only through the institution whose student was the author. bill donovan digital imaging librarian, o'neill library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board .", "hrefTitle": "Oa To

by the open content alliance (to which boston college contributed unique jesuit materials) the internet archive provides access to a wide range of government publications, including hundreds of historical hearings, which were once quite hard to find. additionally the internet archive includes multimedia, such as this film by the department of the interior on the construction of the boulder dam . the federal depository library program also provides access to such databases as the homeland security digital library (hsdl). a collaboration between the department of homeland security, fema,

short, there is a great range of sources of government information freely available. though current publications are generally much easier to find than historical publications, even they can sometimes

(r-tx) and senator joe lieberman, (i-ct) have reintroduced into congress the federal research public access act (frpaa) that they first introduced in 2006. though the earlier version didn't go very far, it received much publicity and promoted widely the principle of open public access to taxpayer supported research. frpaa's principal aim is straightforward, namely to require that final manuscripts of original research papers that have been accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and that result from research supported, in whole or in part, from funding by the federal government be made freely available online as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after publication. the federal research agencies affected by this bill are those with extramural research expenditures of over $100,000,000. these include the department of agriculture, the department of commerce, the department of defense, the department of education, the department of energy, the department of health and human services, the department of homeland security, the department of transportation, the environmental protection agency, the national aeronautics and space administration, and the national science foundation. frpaa, if passed, would follow the march 2009 act requiring that electronic versions of journal articles resulting from research funded by the national institutes of health be deposited into the national library of medicine's online repository, pubmed central (pmc) within 12 months after publication in a journal. many both within and without academia believe that published research that is funded by the federal government, i.e. taxpayers, should be widely and freely available. however, most research results are published in scholarly journals that are often extremely expensive and that are rarely accessible in other than university libraries. as most americans do not have access to the resources of university libraries, they are not able to consult the results and discoveries of federally funded research. as senator lieberman was reported in the congressional record , june 26, 2009: \"while this research is undoubtedly necessary and is beneficial to america, it remains the case that not all americans are capable of experiencing these benefits firsthand. usually the results of the researchers are published in academic journals. despite the fact that the research was paid for by americans' tax dollars, most citizens are unable to attain timely access to the wealth of information that the research provides.\" if frpaa passes \u2013 and some commentators are optimistic that the obama administration will be more favorable to this second version than the previous administration was to the first \u2013 it will be a major advance for the cause of open access. it is certainly true that some publishers are unhappy with the provisions of the frpaa bill. still, the embargo for up to six months provides for publishers to make money through normal channels of publishing. also, this embargo allowing for research to be initially published in a journal before open access dissemination through a digital repository facilitates the continued practice of the traditional peer review process. thus, frpaa appears to be a fair balance of potentially competing interests. brendan rapple collection development librarian

college libraries newsletter volume 11 number 2 fall 2009 copyright and open access most academic writers are interested in getting broad exposure for their work. it\u2019s good for their career, good for their institution and advances knowledge in their field. they want to protect their work from those who would infringe their intellectual property. and, in the traditional academic environment which values publication as part of tenure review, they want to publish in a prestigious journal. copyright can play a chameleon-like role in the process; sometimes a protective barrier, sometimes a stumbling block. many academic writers experience the post-publication shock of being prohibited from use or distribution of their own work. the key to maintaining the freedom to distribute academic writing in an open access environment, such as escholarship@bc (boston college\u2019s digital repository), is to take an active role in managing your rights. traditionally, an author submitting work to an academic journal would be asked to sign the publisher\u2019s contract. no negotiation was expected. the author signed over all rights to the article and was happy to do so for the chance to publish. this is no longer the case. in addition to the traditional publishing outlets, authors want, and are sometimes required, to deposit their work in digital repositories. these requests, far from being seen as unusual, or the mark of a \"difficult\" author, have become commonplace. the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition (sparc) provides, on its website, a form that will generate a pdf document to attach to a journal publisher's copyright agreement, ensuring that the author retains certain rights. science commons the addendum can be customized. for instance, the author may choose to retain sufficient rights to allow the public to re-use the article so long as the author is given credit and the reader's use is non-commercial. another option allows for a choice between immediate posting of the article online or delayed (embargoed) posting after a specific period of time. evidence is steadily mounting that publishers often respond positively to these requests. the sherpa project provides a searchable database of publisher policies regarding depositing in repositories. an aspiring author can look up that prestigious journal in the database and know their stated policies before making her request. the author can also shop for a journal that meets her standards of desired openness. roarmap . authors who wish to deposit their articles in digital

fall 2009 repec: research papers in economics research papers in economics (repec) , is the largest database of bibliographic information related to economics and related disciplines. it is a volunteer-based collaboration of economists and librarians who have formed a 'virtual database' containing information on scholarly literature in economics. repec was established in 1997 by thomas krichel, now a faculty member at long island university, as an outgrowth of the netec project. that project was a consortium of internet projects for academic economists. one of those projects, the wopec (working papers in economics) service, received support from the joint information systems committee (jisc) of the uk higher education funding councils, and is the ancestor of today's repec database. repec is a 'virtual database' in the sense that it is a decentralized network of over 1,000 linked bibliographic archives housed in 68 countries and maintained by their providers. most of these archives contain bibliographic information, or metadata, describing the providers' working papers, discussion papers, preprints or scholarly journals. in september 2009, repec documents over 2,600 working paper series containing over 300,000 titles, of which over 80% are downloadable (while some require paid subscription). a number of archives exclusively contain metadata describing journal articles, many of which are maintained by their respective publishers (in other cases, the publishers provide machine-readable sgml or xml to repec volunteers). the repec database contains information on almost all academic journals in the field of economics as well as many titles in finance, management, statistics and related disciplines. at this writing over 1,000 journal titles are included, with over 470,000 articles documented in repec. the repec database also contains bibliographic information on books (120 series, over 5,500 titles), book chapters (58 series, over 12,500 chapters), and software components (24 series, over 1,800 components). these metadata are linked to a database of economics institutions (edirc, maintained by christian zimmermann) listing over 11,300 institutions. authors of materials in the repec database are encouraged to register in the repec author service , which allows linking of their listings to authored materials and supports citation analysis. over 21,000 individuals, a sizable majority of the profession in many countries, have voluntarily registered. ideas , maintained by christian zimmermann at the university of connecticut, and

established by the munich university library to provide unaffiliated authors with the ability to add their materials to repec. at this writing, mpra contains over 9,100 downloadable papers. in keeping with its decentralized nature, the repec database itself does not contain full texts. its metadata may contain urls that provide access to downloadable full texts of working papers, journal articles and software components. as links to journal articles (and some working papers) may require subscription or payment, repec services provide information on alternate forms of a published article (for instance, working papers freely accessible from their authors' institutions) where those can be identified. freely accessible full text documents are processed by repec's citec service, managed by jos\u00e9 manuel barrueco of the university of valencia. this service extracts citations and attempts to link them to items in the repec database. this allows repec services to both display the included references and citations to a document, and perform citation analysis for working paper series, journal titles and individual authors. another repec service, new economics papers provides a current awareness service for several dozen fields in economics and related disciplines. patrons may freely subscribe to any of the field reports, which are produced by an international team of editors who evaluate working papers added to the repec database. over 25,000 individuals have subscribed to one or more nep reports. boston college is one of the founding members of the repec effort,

libraries: one editor's story for almost ten years i have been the co-editor of teaching exceptional children (tec), a print journal which (we like to boast) is the most widely read journal in the field of special education. there are about 50,000 subscriptions for this bi-monthly journal. the journal is sponsored by the council for exceptional children (cec), which is a national professional and advocacy association. like many professional associations, cec saw membership decline over the past decade and had to enact cost-cutting measures. in 2003, cec decided to cut a signature (16 pages) from the journal, which meant cutting about two to three articles per issue. at that same time, boston college libraries were exploring the option of supporting on-line journals that would be open-access (oa), meaning that they would be immediately available at no cost to anyone in the world with an internet connection. furthermore, in oa journals the authors retain the copyright rather than turning it over to a third party that profits from it. timing was everything. bc was offering to support creation of a new journal, and i had lots of good manuscripts that were either backing up the queue or were being rejected for lack of space. in addition, oa offered the option to attract new kinds of submissions (e.g. articles with embedded video and/or audio, articles with embedded links.) furthermore, moving to the bc-supported system meant that we could take the entire submission process on-line. bc has purchased a license from bepress (berkeley electronic press) that includes

academic year 2008-09, there were over 200,000 total hits. currently, about 20,000 hits per month is the typical rate. remember, however, that these are hits on individual articles. there is no way of

librarian the bc libraries strategic planning burns library . when i interviewed for my position several faculty spoke highly of the treasures collected and housed in the burns library. but an equal number expressed a need to have them more readily discoverable, usable, and intelligible for students and for teaching purposes. these concerns were expressed to the burns staff, as well as the library staff as a whole. i am very pleased to say that we have revised our policies and operations, and are engaging faculty and students to advise us to enable greater access to and description of these unique resources. our initial projects include the digitization of the bobbie hanvey photographic archives that document life during and following the \"troubles\" in northern ireland. we are planning a reception with bobbie himself on november 5th this year, and are hopeful that these materials can be used in several classes and for research across multiple disciplines. the other digitization project, just now getting traction, will make available the collected papers of william butler yeats. we will provide more information on this effort in the coming months. in general, though, the takeaway for faculty is that we are committed to making the burns materials increasingly available for teaching and learning, both at the burns library itself as well as in digital form, as appropriate and feasible. the burns library has a splendid collection, and a staff committed and eager to have these materials used by students and faculty alike. please contact anyone in the burns library to access, use, and create with these special resources. to facilitate user access to the material we have expanded the hours of the burns library to include, for the first time ever, saturday hours (10-2) and wednesday evenings until 8pm. we are at the beginning of what i expect to be an exciting and inclusive process with the digitizing and exposing of the wealth of materials in the burns library. staff from all boston college libraries are involved in these efforts, as are an increasing number of faculty and students. it would be difficult to underestimate the possibilities for us all, as well as the importance of these efforts, moving ahead. on behalf of the entire library staff, let me reiterate our service commitment to you and your students, at burns and all libraries. we look forward to achieving some truly wonderful things together at burns and in all our libraries. as always, feel free to contact me with any suggestions or concerns about the libraries. thomas b.

professor, biology my personal experience with open access publication has shown me the power of this tool to disseminate scholarly work that might otherwise be read by a very restricted audience. in 2006, i was asked to write a review article on protein l-isoaspartyl o-methyltransferases that would be included in a volume on protein methyltransferases in the series, the enzymes . the enzymes is a well-respected series of books that began in 1970 under the editorial leadership of paul boyer, recipient of the 1997 nobel prize in chemistry. for many years, the enzymes was a standard reference work in university libraries. more recently, however, many libraries, including boston college, dropped their subscription to the series, as the costs of other books and journals continued to escalate. i was therefore concerned that many interested readers might not have access to my review. on the recommendation of bc librarian, sally wyman, i contacted elsevier , the publishers of the enzymes , for permission to post a preprint version of my chapter on the bc escholarship site . it was a simple and straightforward process to obtain the publisher's permission. i submitted an online form and, within days, was granted permission to post the preprint version of the chapter. the publication information is included on escholarship, together with a hyperlink to the complete volume at elsevier's own web site. posting the article has turned out to be quite effective in disseminating the chapter to a wide audience. to date, there have been 362 downloads of the article from escholarship, averaging about 10 downloads per month. i am convinced that many of the chapter's readers would not have had access to the article without escholarship. questions, comments? contact the

higher education. supported by 18 catholic colleges and universities, this new format for the journal, which will continue to provide quality, peer-reviewed national and international research and scholarship on catholic education, allows for greater dissemination and availability to practitioners, university faculty, and our international audiences. readers can search and download every article from all 14 volumes of the journal for free by visiting our updated website. boston college librarians have been working over the past 2 years consulting with the governing board on the open access format as well as in the development of the new website. the september 2010 issue of the journal marks the first online edition and one of the final issues available in print. with this transition, we introduce a new look for the journal and will move to a production schedule of just two volumes per year starting with volume 15 in september 2011. the governing board hopes that these changes will not only enhance the journal\u2019s accessibility, but also its viability as a resource for catholic educators and educational researchers. we thank all our readers for their support and hope that the new format of the journal brings exciting new material (including multi-media applications), greater availability, and new scholarship to further advance the field of catholic

thorough understanding of the context of these images, events, and people. additionally, it provides a more widely accessible (and perhaps easier to navigate) method of viewing the photos, though it is a condensed version of the collection. access to the digitool collection is also available via the library\u2019s developing discovery tool, holmes. finally, there is also the main site for the bobbie hanvey photographic archives , which provides an overview of the project, how it is organized, where you can access photos, and information on bobbie hanvey. if you wander over to the current

professor, business law carroll school of management the business law department, carroll school of management, salutes the digital library collections initiative known as escholarship@bc. the business law department was enthusiastic about going forward with the library on a collaboration to upload our publications to the escholarship site, especially after meeting with the library staff, hearing their presentation, and realizing that the project was such a worthwhile endeavor. the four faculty members who contributed to the site have published well over a hundred articles featured in a range of publications, primarily peer-reviewed law journals and reviews. the department has authored dozens of books, a number of which are excerpted on the site. these works span more than thirty years. some parts of this process were matters for the department. for example, department members were responsible for three deliverables to escholarship. for each publication, we were required to produce a short abstract, a copy of the publication, and copyright permission for the article to be digitized, uploaded and re-published on the escholarship site. as with all projects, it seemed overwhelming to read over department members' curriculum vitaes and ask each member to produce copies of each publication, but the faculty responded with alacrity and enthusiasm. likewise, the permissions process seemed that it would be a herculean undertaking at the beginning as it meant rounding up permissions from each publisher. we met occasional resistance from journal editors, but we eventually sold them on the escholarship initiative by showing how the staff adheres to extremely high standards by maintaining original copyright and attribution, and prominently displaying the moniker, as well as other identifying features of the original publication. the library staff exceeded the department's expectation in terms of keeping the project moving. each publication was handled carefully as it moved throughout the campus \u2013 from fulton, to o'neill, to the scanning lab, and so forth. pitfalls for loss and delay were avoided due to the care and professionalism of the library staff. the library staff graciously offered to share these digital files with us so that we can migrate them over to other open access sites such as ssrn, a medium that is increasingly important for business law research. the project was completed recently and it is quite an amazing moment to visit the site and see the research component of our professional life's work up on the web

another year at boston college. we in the boston college libraries are committed to providing you with the highest levels of research support through our many print and online scholarly resources and expert subject librarians eager to assist you. our services have always been strong in-person traditional reference and consultations, and this year we are adding quality mobile library services to the palette. we continue to work strategically in the development of quality discovery tools and the delivery of a new library web site. services we are experimenting with a self-check circulation station in o'neill library and expanding access to text reference and virtual chat for the boston college community. in response to the growing demand for support with multimedia content, two high-end mac video editing machines are now available in the o'neill reference area. our instruction services remain a vital part of our work. we can come to classes, populate course pages with relevant links and reserve materials, and work directly with students in course research and assignment support. additionally, we have tremendous special collections in the burns library with unique resources and a talented staff ready to help both faculty and students in the access and use of these materials. space our library facilities are undergoing changes (and we welcome your suggestions!). along with the technologically-equipped group study rooms and level 1 booth-like study areas, we have implemented a technology help center in the o'neill library. also on level 1 is a circulation point (right next to the new popular reading collection). the o'neill hours have been extended to 3am and gargan hall in the bapst library, recently voted the most beautiful library in the united states by campus grotto, remains open 24/5. the vestibule in o'neill has been upgraded with seating, shelves for university publications, a public bulletin board, and a digital screen for campus and library announcements. feel free to let us know if you want to publicize an event via these screens. we hope all of these changes and enhancements will increase your engagement with us and your presence in the library. as a final note, the reserves room in o'neill will be the gathering point for multiple academic presentations. this is in support of space needs during the gasson renovations, but it fits perfectly with my vision of library as a place -- a place that also includes faculty-student engagement and discussion. in a similar vein, gargan hall in bapst will welcome many musical events in the upcoming academic year. staffing as you know, the library, along with the rest of the university, is challenged in facing staffing needs, vacancies, and opportunities. some staff have departed and others are on leave, but we are fortunate that we have been able to do some recruitment. for others, we are lucky to have staff in the library willing to take on additional responsibilities and face new challenges. we are currently interviewing for a scholarly communications librarian, a key strategic position in the library, and one which we hope will lead to new and different types of engagement with you. in addition, we continue our search for an associate university librarian for public services, another vital strategic position in the administration. as i mentioned, several staff are stepping up and taking on new responsibilities. a key one is the media librarian, as julie decesare accepted a position at providence college. kelly webster (x2.1064) is currently the point person for media video collection development. for those of you who generally submit collection recommendations to other media staff, there is no need to stop that practice. for those who want more discussion about the direction of media collections or have feedback about the collection, please contact kelly. we want your input and kelly is charged to enhance the patron initiated collections process. others include sarah hogan , who continues to cover sociology; ken liss is supporting the history department, nina bogdanovsky political science, and adeane bregman film studies. please feel free to contact any of these librarians for your collection and service needs. moving on as always, feel free to contact me with any suggestions or concerns about the libraries. thomas b. wall , ph.d.

pamela egan professor of computer science carroll school of management for your books and articles that have been posted on the web, do you have reason to believe that there have been many downloads taking place? how do you know? the pdf that you created for the book algorithmic aesthetics by george stiny and james gips, university of california press, 1978 was posted on the web for free download at www.algorithmicaesthetics.org (and also at my bc website ). from the statistics provided by the server for algorithmicaesthetics.org i can see that there have been 5829 downloads from that website since the file was posted in june. by having such scholarship freely available on the web, do you think that a wider audience will be reached --- as compared with relying on standard print publications? the total number of printed copies of algorithmic aesthetics sold by university of california press from 1978 on was 912. how did you first learn about the libraries' service in posting faculty publications on boston college's escholarship website? was this service satisfactory in your case? the service in scanning and creating pdfs for out of print articles and books was absolutely outstanding. for what types of publications do you think open access (free access via the internet) would be most helpful in promoting scholarship? (out-of-print books and articles, new or recently published books and articles, bc-published e-journals, all of the above)? all of the above. besides improving access to your own out-of-print books and articles, has the open access service of the libraries also made these works easier for scholars to discover? honestly, i don't know about the services of making the books and articles available. i take it upon myself to make the books and articles available at their own special websites and at my bc website. in your discipline, is there a need to facilitate discovery of and access to the rapidly growing body of scholarly literature? yes. the literature is so diverse, in so many locations, it is difficult for people to find and access relevant work. would open access peer-reviewed journals be an attractive mode of publication to you and your colleagues? yes. some funding agencies are now asking that funded research results be made publicly available (for free) within a limited time after the research grant period ends. do you think that these types of policies will serve society\u2019s interests well? yes, definitely. how would you feel about retaining some of your copy rights (e.g., the right to repurpose your own published works) when publishing --- this would involve adding an addendum to your publishing contracts? would you desire assistance in preserving some of your copy rights? it is tough to require retaining some of your copy rights if the journal where you are trying to publish insists otherwise. any recommendations for boston college or its libraries regarding open access? i'm all for open access but it will be a tough battle for current work.

canadian institutes of health research (cihr) ; howard hughes medical institute ; european research council ; swiss national science foundation . currently six of the uk's seven research councils have a mandation policy. however, while most science, medical, technological research in the us and overseas is directly financed by funding agencies, both state and private, much arts, humanities, even social science research is not. so, relying on funder mandates to achieve deposit of peer reviewed material into digital repositories means that a great amount of research productivity in many disciplines is left out. consequently, while funder mandates are clearly potentially better than voluntary deposition policies, it stands to reason that universities requiring deposit of their members' research articles into their digital ir will result in substantially more open access articles in more disciplines. , 13 feb., 2008 voting unanimously to mandate that their peer reviewed articles be deposited in a digital institutional repository and be open access. university of stirling become the uk's first academic institution to oblige staff to make all their published research available online. the same week, the university of southampton whose school of electronics and computer science was the first (1999) in the world to adopt a self-archiving mandate has now applied the mandation policy to the whole university. other institutional mandates include: queensland university of technology ; cern: european organization for nuclear research ; university of minho (portugal) ; university of zurich . digital repositories are vehicles for the democratization of the dissemination of information and knowledge. presently there is a problematic access barrier to much scholarship, namely the exorbitant price of many journals, which naturally results in low readership. however, a network of irs whose free scholarly content can be harvested by such search engines as google clearly has the potential of opening scholarship, much of which has been funded at taxpayer's expense, to a far greater number of readers. in addition to this ethical rationale, irs help to enlarge an institution's visibility and prestige, thereby attracting more qualified students and faculty. more research funds will be garnered. it would seem obvious that faculty would welcome irs. faculty want their research to be read. having it deposited in digital irs will ensure that it be disseminated far more widely as well as more speedily. it will then be cited more. though the benefits of irs seem patent, the challenge is populating them with appropriate scholarship. voluntary deposit by faculty into university irs throughout the us, and overseas, has generally been extremely low. my recommendation is that universities require deposit, in short, an institutional mandate. brendan rapple collection development questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe to the boston college libraries newsletter", "hrefTitle": "More Open Access To Faculty Scholarship", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2008summer/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Fighting Irishmen: Celebrating Celtic Prizefighters 1820 to the Present", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/about/exhibits/burns/fighting-irishmen.html", "text": "fighting irishmen: celebrating celtic prizefighters 1820 to the present skip to main content boston college library ever to excel search bc secondary navigation: a \u2013 z bcinfo maps directories runlibraries();

the 18th century collection includes sessional papers from both houses of parliament along with bills, acts, journals, and debates. the 19th century collection of approximately 80,000 sessional papers includes the house of commons material and those house of lords papers that were presented to the house of commons. the 20th and 21st century includes house of commons material from 1901 to 2003/2004. famine in ireland, the slave trade, children\u2019s employment during the industrial revolution, cattle plague, correspondence related to pasteur's germ theory, the amount of coffee delivered to troops in crimea on the hms industry are just some of the subject headings of the collections of papers. the papers are those documents that came about through deliberations of the house of commons or papers providing the necessary information for the members to carry out their work. sometimes called \"sessional papers\", the papers include bills, reports of committees, reports presented by special commissions and government agencies, and \"accounts and papers\", including statistics, international agreements and treaties. for more information on the type of material that hcpp includes go to the guide to the parliamentary papers . the house of commons parliamentary papers do not include the debates of the house of lords or commons, other than the 18th century material mentioned above.

british interest or interactions with china and japan. the failure of the potato crop in ireland during the mid-nineteenth century caused devastation in every aspect of life for those irish who relied on the potato to subsist. reports related to the potato blight and to measures taken by the british government to alleviate conditions that resulted from the subsequent famine detail the vast numbers of people affected and reveal differing views on how relief should be provided. a researcher interested in finding a report of the failure of the potato crop can perform a search using the session and paper number, for example 1848 (session) 33 (paper number), if one has this information. if not, a researcher may do the following search. click on \"search\" and type \"famine\" in the keyword field; scroll down the search page and click on \"select from a hierarchical 19th century subject list.\" select \"ireland\" and click on \"show all sub-headings.\" select \"agriculture\", then \"potatoes (ireland)\" and click \"select\" and then \"search.\" the search will retrieve \"extract of report of commissioners of inquiry into matters connected with the failure of the potato crop.\" from this

books no longer constitute some esoteric medium whose potential scholarly utility is viewed with suspicion by many faculty and students. hundreds of thousands of books in electronic format are readily available though such databases as early english books online , evans early american imprints one and two , eighteenth century collections online , acls humanities e-book project and others. while these are costly databases, numerous other digitized books are freely accessible to anyone with internet access. a goal of the google book project is to digitize as many as thirty million print books. if a book digitized by google is in the public domain or if the publisher has given permission, the full book is available to be read online, printed out, or downloaded. hundreds of thousands of open access e-texts are also available through other sites, for example the university of michigan digital library text collection , the oxford text archive , the electronic text center at the university of virginia , the french site gallica , the project bartleby archive ; project gutenberg ; and many others. the internet archive , part of the open content alliance (oca) , has at the time of writing 1,422,065 freely accessible digital texts. inanimate alice 'e-book' e-books are by no means limited to digitized versions of print books. many e-books are digital only and possess such multimedia features as sound, video, animated graphics thereby producing a qualitatively different notion of what a book is. e-books can also have the valuable enhancement of allowing the reader to call up through hyperlinks the actual document mentioned in a reference. thus one may easily toggle between texts or even have several different texts open on one\u2019s screen concurrently. hypertext fiction has been around many years. this is fiction where the reader chooses hyperlinks to move from one part of the text to another and to create their own individual text thereby engaging in reading that is quite different to traditional linear reading of sentence by sentence, from first page to last. michael joyce\u2019s reach (2000) is a good example, as is deena larsen\u2019s 2000 disappearing rain . not dissimilar is kate pullinger\u2019s and chris joseph\u2019s 2006 inanimate alice , a story of interactive episodes combining text, sound, images, and games. another example is stuart moulthrop\u2019s 2007 r adio salience . there is also a growing number of websites focusing on scholarly electronic editions of well known texts often accompanied by contextual essays, commentary, analysis, notes, comparison of side-by-side texts, visual and the devil's walk 'e-book' audio features. several examples from the field of literature include, among numerous others: an e-edition of percy bysshe shelley's the devil's walk ; the william blake archive ; the walt whitman archive ; the dickinson electronic archives ; the decameron web ; the princeton dante project ; hap hazard: a manuscript resource for spenser studies ; the diary of samuel pepys ; early stuart libels . arguably such e-editions can facilitate innovative methods of discovering, interacting with and analyzing texts and, accordingly, different and potentially deeper scholarship than traditional print editions. the notion of what is a book is clearly evolving. how exactly do we define a book today? must it have physicality to be a book? is an e-book only a text and not also a book? presumably a text can have sound, video, computer graphics, hyperlinks, other web content? can a book have such attributes and still be a book? what is war and peace , originally a print book, when transformed into the digital media files of a podcast and then downloaded onto a mp3? is it no longer a book? maybe all these are inconsequential questions and the diverse evolving formats are not to be defined according to narrow and perhaps outdated criteria. certainly it may be argued that different formats, different media result in different perceptions and understandings by the reader. sven birkerts in a march 2009 article in the atlantic sees a necessary difference between formats. though the reader will perceive the words of pride and prejudice, whether in electronic or print format in the same sequence, \u201c[w] hat will change is the receiving sensibility, the background understanding of what this text was \u2013 how it emerged and took its place in the context of other texts\u2014and how it moved through the culture.\u201d birkerts acknowledges that there are benefits in digitization but he also believes that there is a distinct trade-off, i.e. \u201caccess versus context\u201d. still, while accepting that perceptions and understandings depend in part on the format, it may be asked whether there is some hierarchy of formats in the scholarly world and to what extent, if any, can format be equated with quality? in the academic sphere where decisions regarding one\u2019s tenure, promotion, and funding depend in large part on the quality of the individual\u2019s scholarship, attitudes towards the format of the dissemination of that scholarship are likely to be crucial. while birkerts makes an important point, i\u2019ll go out on a limb and propose that for many readers the actual words are what matters most. reading the text for content is why the majority of us consult books. the materiality of the artifact on which the text is read is generally of less importance. obviously there are numerous exceptions and i\u2019m certainly not negating the immense value, scholarly, aesthetic, emotional, and otherwise of actually consulting, say, one of the five extant manuscript copies of the gettysburg address. though one may access the words of william butler yeats\u2019s verse play mosada in numerous editions, many will experience a particularly special and very distinct feeling reading it in the very rare 1943 cuala press edition owned by burns\u2019s library. consulting a digitized incunabulum is clearly rather different to handling and reading the actual 15th century original. the examples might be multiplied many times. nevertheless, i suspect that for most readers a facsimile of words is a perfectly acceptable alternative to the original print copy. and if the facsimile is in digital format many might consider that this is a benefit. certainly, some authors are interested in the physical appearance of their text, that is specify how their words will appear on the printed page. laurence sterne was very prescriptive how his tristram easter wings shandy (1765-1769) should be printed, specifying blank pages , black pages , gaps for the reader to insert text. authors of concrete or visual poetry are other exceptions, george herbert\u2019s \u201ceaster-wings\u201d and hrabanus marus\u2019s \"de adoratione crucis ab opifice\u201d being two 17th century examples. still, most authors leave it to the printer to express the sense of their work in typographical format. and many, i suspect, will be satisfied, even happy, to have their work disseminated widely in digital format with concerns about the physical appearance and materiality of the text ignored. just as scribal manuscript culture coexisted with gutenberg\u2019s new invention for a least a century before fading away, it is likely that the printed book will continue side-by-side with e-books and all forms of e-texts for a long time to come. the traditional book is far from meeting obsolescence in the near future. however, e-books and e-texts will undoubtedly evolve and it would be rash to predict what sort of innovation they will display in, say, a decade\u2019s time. it is true that the academy is beginning to be more accepting of the new technology. while this is more manifest in the sciences, the humanities and social sciences are not being left behind. still, an optimal intellectual and physical infrastructure that supports and rewards such technology as e-books and e-texts has still far to go. our cultural commonwealth , the 2006 report of the american council of learned societies commission on cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social sciences, is apt in stating \u201cthat digital scholarship is the inevitable future of the humanities and social sciences, and that digital literacy is a matter of national competitiveness and a mission that needs to be embraced by universities, libraries, museums, and archives\u201d (34). boston college libraries are cognizant of the urgency of this need and are keen to seek faculty and student input regarding how best to facilitate both the production and dissemination of such digital scholarship while maintaining the highest library and informational standards of traditional print-based scholarship. brendan rapple collection development librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe to the boston college libraries

do with your journal articles once they have been published? when you have signed the journal\u2019s copyright transfer agreement, can you also put a version of the article in an open access repository like escholarship@bc ? you may be surprised that, generalizing across all disciplines, 87% of the time the answer may be yes . trends in academic publishing last semester tom wall, university librarian, and i visited the provost\u2019s advisory council to discuss open access trends in academic publishing. one topic of discussion was the deposit of faculty articles in escholarship. faculty members on the council were curious about the role of copyright in this process. having signed many copyright transfer agreements, many were under the impression that they could no longer deposit those works. the open access \u201cmovement\u201d has put pressure on publishers to allow authors to retain greater control over their intellectual property. some have responded, but stark disciplinary differences exist. society publishers often derive significant income from membership fees which pay for a subscription to the society journal. worries about financial viability may lead them to be restrictive with this content. other journals have adopted a policy of embargoing the open accessibility of articles for a period of time. this approach attempts to balance the rights of the author (allowing eventual open access to their work) and the publishers (allowing a period of exclusive publication to recoup publishing costs). some mainstream academic publishers (springer, taylor & francis, wiley, among others) have adopted their own open access hybrid model \u2013 allowing some articles in a traditional journal to be immediately openly accessible, upon payment of a hefty article processing fee. these fees are often paid from grant funds or from open access funds which some universities have established. for authors without grants or access to a university fund, the cost ($3000 is typical) can be prohibitive. our investigation of journal policies during our discussion with the provost\u2019s advisory council, faculty members requested that the libraries provide each department with a snapshot of the current climate among journals in their disciplines. the subject liaison librarians have each been working on this project. our method was to create a list of journals generally recognized as important in the discipline and/or represented on the cvs of faculty in the department. to find the journals\u2019 individual policies on author self-archiving in their institution\u2019s repository, we first consulted sherpa/romeo , a resource maintained for this purpose. if policies for the journals were not reported there, or were ambiguous, we checked the journal publisher\u2019s website and, in some cases, emailed the permissions office of the journal. each liaison librarian created a spreadsheet of policies for the list of journals in their discipline. we aggregated the results to draw some more general conclusions. our goal was to determine which, if any, version of an author\u2019s article could be deposited in an institutional repository, such as escholarship@bc, without asking the publisher\u2019s permission or paying a fee . summary of results as expected, we found wide differences in the journal policies across disciplines. in many of the sciences and social sciences, policies regarding deposit are very liberal \u2013 in some disciplines all of the journals listed allowed some version to be deposited. in the humanities several journals had no published policy on the issue. in a few disciplines, usually dominated by a scholarly society publisher, some journals allowed no deposit at all. in general, preprint versions (original manuscripts before peer review) and postprints (the author\u2019s final accepted manuscript with changes based on peer-review) were the versions most likely to be free of restrictions. only a few journals allow posting of the final formatted publisher\u2019s version. almost all require linking or citing the original published source. a compilation of the charts for each discipline surveyed is attached . most departments have received a spreadsheet of the journals surveyed in their disciplines, and their policies. if anyone would like to see the spreadsheets of other disciplines, please just email your subject liaison or me. depositing your work in escholarship of the 503 journals included in our group, we found that 87% would allow some version of the author\u2019s article to be deposited in escholarship. depositing work in escholarship showcases the work of individual faculty members and the quality of work done at boston college. it eliminates economic barriers to knowledge for readers everywhere and increases discovery and citation counts. it also delivers a permanent web address for an article that can be added to a cv. we have some new

a few years ago, several younger african historians were astonished to meet someone whose name they knew from a monograph on pre-colonial nigeria published back in 1978. though i was alive and kicking, they knew my long out-of-print book only from dog-eared photocopies passed from hand to hand. why not make e-copies available, i thought, but the publisher, oxford university press, is not yet ready to free up any of its considerable out-of-print backlist. i have been more fortunate in resurrecting two other works that had also exhausted their print lives. ohio university press had surrendered the rights to my monograph on the congo (zaire) at the time it went out of print, and, when i asked, cambridge university press readily granted me full rights to my study of indentured labor. i am gratified that both have been downloaded dozens of times in their new formats. some day, i hope, oup will realize that scholarship once issued in book form should be made as accessible as back-copies of journal articles have become. in the meantime, scholars need to keep up the pressure on publishers to cede the rights to works that are no longer revenue producing. david northrup history department did you publish a book that is now out of print? although the publisher may not be interested in reprinting or promoting it, there are opportunities to breathe new life into your work and obtain new readers. once a book is out of print or a number of years have passed, copyright may revert to the author. this can be automatic or may require affirmative steps. if you have an older work that is still useful to readers, you can refer to your publication contract or check in with your contact at the publishing house to see if copyright can be transferred back to you. if you have retained copyright to your work, or if copyright has reverted to you, the boston college libraries can help you give the work new exposure through our membership in the open content alliance (oca). oca is the collaborative effort by cultural, technology, nonprofit, and governmental organizations from around the world, working to build a permanent archive of multilingual digitized text and multimedia material. oca content is hosted by the internet archive. the boston college libraries have contributed more than 1,400 titles to the oca initiative. our initial contributions emphasized rare and unique content. in preparation for the boston college sesquicentennial celebration, recent contributions have emphasized historical bc materials such as the subturri, the well (the newton college of the sacred heart yearbooks) and the bc alumni magazine. the open content alliance maintains a very sophisticated scanning operation at the boston public library and scans works for oca members for a reasonable fee. the boston college collection of contributed material is available to browse on the internet archive website. recently, we have had the opportunity to contribute two works authored by prof. david northrup of the history department. copyright of the works, published in 1988 and 1995, had reverted to him. you can see the resulting digital works in the boston college collection: beyond the bend in the river: african labor in eastern zaire, 1865-1940 indentured labor in the age of imperialism, 1834-1922 you will notice that many versions of the work are produced, and each is fully downloadable. in addition to html and pdf versions a daisy version can be accessed by the visually impaired, a kindle version available for use on the amazon e-readers and an epub version for more universal e-reader access. each work has a permanent url that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. statistics on downloads are available right in the record for each item. in the first 3 months that beyond the bend in the river was available, it was downloaded 82 times. compare this to the 238 copies available worldwide in libraries, according to worldcat. assuming that the number of downloads holds fairly steady, it is clear that exposure and accessibility of the material is greatly enhanced. in addition, a little-known provision of u.s. copyright law could help bc authors regain control over their works. section 203 allows authors to notify publishers that they wish to take back copyright to their works published after january 1, 1978. publishers must be given at least two years notice, and there is a small five-year window in which the termination of copyright transfer can be done (35 to 40 years after publication). so, the first rights regained by authors under this provision will be freed up in 2013, assuming notice had been given at least two years before. provisions of this section are fairly exacting and can easily trap the unwary. if faculty authors are interested in taking advantage of the provision, please take a look at the copyright office explanation and regulations about the termination notice. feel free to contact jane morris , the scholarly communication librarian, for help interpreting the copyright transfer termination rules. if you have retained copyright to any of your work, or if it has reverted to you for any reason, you have a great opportunity to give it new life and worldwide readership through the boston college collection in the internet archive. jane morris scholarly communications

university\u2019s archives, are housed in the honorable john j. burns library, located in the bapst library building, north entrance. burns library staff work with students and faculty to support learning and teaching at boston college, offering access to unique primary sources through instruction sessions, exhibits, and programming. the burns library also serves the research needs of external scholars, hosting researchers from around the globe interested in using the collections. the burns library is home to more than 250,000 volumes and over 700 manuscript collections, including holdings of music, photographic materials, art and artifacts, and ephemera. though its collections cover virtually the entire spectrum of human knowledge, the burns library has achieved international recognition in several specific areas of research, most notably: irish studies; british catholic authors; jesuitica; fine printing; catholic liturgy and life in america, 1925-1975; boston history; the caribbean, especially jamaica; nursing; and congressional archives. to learn more about specific holdings in burns, click on the collection listings below. you can also connect with the burns library

are among the listings at www.bc.edu/digitalcollections . selected resources rare books collection the burns library houses an impressive array of bound volumes from thirteenth-century illuminated codices on vellum to special limited editions of modern press books. old and/or rare or fragile or valuable volumes that do not fit neatly into discrete subject collections, e.g., jesuitica, are grouped into the rare books collection. rarities include an early fourteenth-century franciscan antiphonary on vellum with the rhymed offices of st. francis and st. clare, containing an apparently unrecorded 14-stanza sequence in honor of st. francis, plus an extremely rare example of franciscan polyphony; a beautifully-illuminated dutch book of hours on vellum with four exquisite miniatures (ca. 1470); a stunning fifteenth-century french book of hours on vellum with 15 large and 14 small miniatures with foliated borders; more than thirty incunabula or fifteenth-century printed books, including the 1473 edition of the decretales of pope gregory ix, printed in mainz, germany by peter schoeffer; significant holdings of early modern european and latin american imprints, including a first edition of the two-volume rheims-douai bible (1582, 1609-10); and a number of important facsimiles, including the fine arts facsimile copy of the book of kells . certain of the library's most rare and exciting volumes are to be found, however, as part of discrete subject collections. for example, the rare and much coveted mosada of william butler yeats, the poet's first printed book, is part of the library's renowned irish collection. see also rare books and special collections descriptions . special collections the burns library is home to more than twenty special subject

librarian for boston college, please allow me to introduce myself. i have spent the past eight years at duke university as associate university librarian for public services, and the 13 years before that as a faculty member and head of public services at the university of pittsburgh. in all my experiences, among the most rewarding has been working to ensure that the library excels as a user focused organization, and i see the library as essential to the social and academic well-being of the university. through a combination of services, collections, technology and spaces the libraries support the entire range of student learning activities, from idea formation to knowledge production and dissemination. already this spring many of you have welcomed me to administrative and faculty departmental meetings, which have been extremely helpful in considering ways the library can fulfill its mission. in this spirit i hope to have a chance to visit all academic departments through the fall term 2009. i consider the library\u2019s engagement with faculty key in building strong and relevant collections (both print and digital), integrating library services and staff into the academic life of students, and creating a dialogue on critical library issues on space, programs, and services. i look forward to working with the faculty library advisory committee on ways to improve the library, and am available to attend departmental meetings at any time to discuss partnerships, policies, any ideas you have about the libraries. the staff in the bc libraries will work with you as partners in creating a library environment that will meet your research needs through responsive services and collections. i hope we can work together to further develop spaces for learning and collaboration, facilitate the social importance of the library, and strengthen our core programs and collections, as well as envision new directions for us all. i pledge an environment of open communication with the entire campus community; respecting and addressing all concerns. i am very excited about the future for the boston college libraries; a future that depends on us working together. i will also be initiating a library strategic plan this summer to address many of the issues raised in my faculty and administrative visits. you may expect that librarians will be in touch to get your input on our strategic planning process and implementation. in closing, let me reiterate that i consider users as critical partners to the library, and i welcome all feedback that may help us serve the research and teaching needs of both faculty and students. please feel free to contact me at tbw@bc.edu , or stop by 410 o'neill. thomas b. wall , ph.d. university librarian questions,

\u201cwe are convinced that our universities distinguish themselves, and achieve excellence, by their willingness to open their gates and share their most important assets \u2014 the ideas and innovative solutions they create each day.\u201d from values and scholarship, an essay by eleven research university provosts, published february 23, 2012, in inside higher ed. the past six months have been an interesting and active time in the national debate over access to academic research. a few of the highlights (and low points) are summarized below. in november, the white house office of science and technology policy issued a request for information soliciting public input on public access to the results of federally funded research, including peer-reviewed scholarly publications. the boston college university libraries submitted a detailed response, recommending that all such articles be required to be made publically available as soon as possible. (all responses are available here .) on december 16, the research works act (rwa) was introduced in congress. the bill (hr 3699), co-sponsored by darrell issa (r-ca) and carolyn maloney (d-ny), sought to repeal the open-access policy at the nih and block similar policies at other federal agencies. currently the nih policy requires that all articles resulting from research funded by the nih be deposited within one year of publication in the open access pubmed central. initially, the association of american publishers came out in support of the bill. many academic publishers (mit press, university of california press, penn state university press, and others) broke ranks and voiced opposition. elsevier, often cited as a publisher practicing predatory bundling and pricing, publically supported the rwa. on january 21, timothy gowers, fields medalist and mathematician at the university of cambridge, made public his longstanding boycott of elsevier: \u201cit occurs to me that it might help if there were a website somewhere, where mathematicians who have decided not to contribute in any way to elsevier journals could sign their names electronically.\u201d within days, the cost of knowledge was up, and as of february 28, 7570 researchers had become signatories, vowing not to publish in, referee or edit elsevier journals. that number stands at 9598 on april 12. several boston college faculty members are signatories. on february 9, representative mike doyle (d-pa) introduced bipartisan legislation that directs federal agencies to encourage open public access to federally funded scientific research. the federal research public access act (frpaa) would require federal agencies with an extramural research budget of $100 million or more to make federally-funded research available for free online access by the general public, no later than six months after publication in a peer-reviewed journal. on february 23, eleven provosts of large research universities published a letter in support of open access and frpaa, and in opposition to rwa. they outline an agenda for change: some examples of how we might do more to influence campus behaviors include: encouraging faculty members to retain enough rights in their published intellectual property that they can share it with colleagues and students, deposit it in open access repositories, and repurpose it for future research. ensuring that promotion and tenure review are flexible enough to recognize and reward new modes of communicating research outcomes. ensuring that our own university presses and scholarly societies are creating models of scholarly publishing that unequivocally serve the research and educational goals of our universities, and/or the social goals of our communities. encouraging libraries and faculty to work together to assess the value of purchased or licensed content, and the appropriate terms governing its use. on february 27, elsevier withdrew its support for the rwa and announced price cuts for mathematics journals. the same day, the chronicle of higher education reported that the bill was dead, quoting the bill\u2019s co-sponsors: \u201cas the costs of publishing continue to be driven down by new technology, we will continue to see a growth in open-access publishers. this new and innovative model appears to be the wave of the future,\" the issa-maloney statement said. \"the american people deserve to have access to research for which they have paid. this conversation needs to continue, and we have come to the conclusion that the research works act has exhausted the useful role it can play in the debate.\u201d on march 19, a congressional briefing on frpaa resulted in 24 new bipartisan sponsors of the bill, and on march 29, the subcommittee on investigations and oversight (of the committee on science, space and technology) held a hearing titled examining public access and scholarly publication interests. argument for open access to taxpayer-funded research: the federal agencies and science policies that this committee oversees have led to knowledge breakthroughs of the most fundamental sort \u2014 in our understanding of the physical universe, in our ability to comprehend fundamental biological processes, and, in my own field, in the revolutionary abilities to transform and transmit information. open access policies build on these information technology breakthroughs to maximize the return on the taxpayers\u2019 enormous investment in that research, and magnify the usefulness of that research. they bring economic benefits that far exceed the costs. the nih has shown one successful model, which could be replicated at other funding agencies, as envisioned in the recently re-introduced bipartisan federal research public access act (frpaa). providing open access to the publicly-funded research literature \u2014 amplifying the \u201cdiffusion of knowledge\u201d \u2014 will benefit researchers, taxpayers, and every person who gains from new medicines, new technologies, new jobs, and new solutions to longstanding problems of every kind the issues are complex and the argument has been contentious. more testimony is available, and the alliance for taxpayer access , of which the boston college university libraries are a member, provides resources to support the bill. we will continue to report new

volume 11 number 1 summer 2009 recent acquisitions by burns library in recent months burns has added a number of exciting acquisitions to its collection. space does not permit an exhaustive listing of these acquisitions. what follows are a few highlights: addition to early modern scientific works copernicus, nicolaus. de revolutionibus . amsterdam: wilhelmus jansonius, 1617. this is the third edition, the first edition to include commentary by nicholaus m\u00fcller of groningen, of copernicus\u2019s classic work. copies of this edition are quite rare. the first edition of de revolutionibus (1543) is widely considered to be the most important scientific work published in the 16th century. a first edition copy recently sold for $2,300,000. the copernicus joins two other early editions of the most important scientific works of the early modern period to be held by burns, namely, a first edition of galileo\u2019s classic work on sunspots, istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari e loro accidenti : comprese in tre lettere scritte all'illvstrissimo signor marco velseri ... / dal signor galileo galilei ... ; si aggiungono nel fine le lettere, e disquisizioni del finto apelle [christoph scheiner]. in roma : appresso giacomo mascardi, mdcxiii [1613]; and an extremely rare eighteenth-century reprint of the second edition of sir isaac newton\u2019s principia mathematica , together with an elusive essay on principles of calculus (amsterdam, 1723). the copernicus and the newton works were purchased through a collaborative effort involving the provost\u2019s office, the physics department, and boston college libraries. the galileo was a gift of wega and angelo firenze, from the library of wega\u2019s father, acclaimed physicist pasquale sconzo. these core works in the history of science provide students at bc with a study and research opportunity few other institutions are able to offer. every year some 150 bc students visit burns to do research projects involving the newton and the galileo. with the addition of the copernicus, more research opportunities are anticipated. limited edition ulysses joyce, james. ulysses . paris: by john rodker

france in october 1922 from the plates used for the first shakespeare press edition of ulysses (february 1922), this edition is referred to as the first english edition. it was from this edition that

6 in. private collection. love and death by w.b. yeats the manuscript here transcribed represents an important addition to w.b. yeats's canon, complementing those already transcribed in the cornell yeats volumes. the entire manuscript of yeats's unpublished play, love and death , which he composed in 1884, totals five notebooks, some of which contain loose-leaf inserted papers. the play is significant for being the first written by yeats. it has never before been published or performed. yeats composed it in the same year that he began writing mosada and the island of statues , his earliest published plays. love and death is valuable, in part, for the light it sheds on the poet's other work from this period. the content of all five notebooks has been scanned in full and the use of facsimiles made possible by the burns library at boston college. the transcription includes a full draft of the play and yeats's partial revisions. his corrections, cancellations and occasional spelling errors are included. the work presented here will be of interest to yeats scholars, particularly those studying the poet's juvenilia, to scholars of irish literature, and to a general public eager to read some of yeats's earliest writing. manuscript samples acknowledgements the transcription and contents of the website were prepared by dathalinn m. o'dea, boston college, with the advice

faculty and students have a wealth of audio and video information available to them through the media center and the bc libraries. our physical collection of music and moving images continues to grow with cds and dvds, while the libraries\u2019 digital initiatives have fostered the streamed film collection. a portion of the physical collection is available to the entire bc community for circulation, while the media center and subject specialists work with faculty to create a diverse instructional collection. the library also subscribes to databases such as smithsonian global sound , naxos music library , poets on screen (literature online) , and the vanderbilt television news archive to provide licensed multimedia content to the bc community. over the near future, the bc community will see resources like this increase to reflect the demand for multimedia content by students and faculty. in addition to resources provided by the library, the multimedia search engines i\u2019ve included in this article will help you locate sound, image and video files -- as well as radio and television programs. the web is a great resource for finding instructional, entertaining, and/or enriching aural and visual materials. the sites i\u2019ve listed below incorporate all of these aspects. some things to keep in mind: some of these websites are corporate, while others are library, archive, and educational initiatives. most of these sites are free, but will include advertising or additional fees for subscription service. some sites give an option for a \u201cfamily filter\u201d or \u201csafe search\u201d to weed out adult content, others do not. make sure the internet browser you are using (firefox, safari, aol, internet explorer, etc.) permits pop-up windows. most sites that allow you to upload video content are protected by the on-line copyright infringement liability limitation act (ocilla), a provision of the digital millennium copyright act section 512 . these provisions are designed to shelter service providers from the infringing activities of their customers. the internet service is required to delete any infringing content, if notified and requested to do so by the copyright holder. if you are interested in the legal side of these sites, i highly recommend the electronic frontier foundation , which keeps a very close watch on lawsuits and legislation surrounding the internet. certain requirements can affect how well you can view or listen to content on your computer. operating systems, file formats, software requirements, browser limitations, and broadband speed, can all affect the quality of the sound or image. most likely, an error message will appear on your screen, if there is an issue. it is also a good idea to check \u201cabout\u201d or \u201cfaq\u201d of the website to read about multimedia technical requirements. blinkx -- google video -- google video is the multimedia portal of the massive search engine. it relies on closed captioning and transcripts for its keyword searches. google video is an open online video marketplace, where you can search for, watch and even buy an ever-growing collection of tv shows, movies, music videos, documentaries, personal productions and more. google offers free video content, but also provides an option to rent or purchase multimedia content. purchased content requires a google account and a downloadable google player. google account holders are also able to upload video content they created. the uploaded video does not have to be shown publicly, users are able to set access preferences. google has partnered with nara (the national archives and records administration) to include a national archives video section of historical movies, documentaries and other films. pandora -- pandora\u2019s interface is available to music lovers so they can use this musical system to discover new music based on songs or artists they already know. once you set up a personal, free account, the system will ask for you to name a favorite musician or song. the interactive interface will then play songs based on the musical components of that suggestion. also, like an interactive radio, you can tell the database if you liked the song it played, or disliked it. seven years in the making, the project started as the music genome project. pandora\u2019s team of fifty musician-analysts have been listening to music, one song at a time, studying and collecting literally hundreds of musical details (over 400 attributes) on every song. it takes an average of 20-30 minutes per song to capture all of the details that give each recording its sound - melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals, lyrics, etc. open video project -- the purpose of the open video project is to collect and make available a repository of digitized video content for the digital video, multimedia retrieval, digital library, and other research communities. the open video project began in 1998 with the development of a basic framework and the digitization of the initial content, about 195 video segments. additional video was also contributed by the cmu informedia project, the howard hughes medical institute, and the prelinger archives. this first stage of the project also included entering metadata for each segment into a database, and creating the web site to enable researchers to access the available video. users are able to browse by genre, color, sound, duration, and collection. moving image collection -- national audio visual conservation center and is working to develop industry standards on moving image collecting and digital video. folkstreams -- according to the website, folkstreams has two goals; to build a national preserve of hard-to-find, independent documentary films about american folk or roots cultures, and to give them new life by streaming them on the internet. the films are streamed with essays about the traditions and the filmmaking process. the films, which were produced between the 1960s and the present, focus on the culture, challenges, and arts of unnoticed americans from a range of different regions and communities. the site includes transcriptions, study and teaching guides, suggested readings, and links to related websites. librivox -- librivox volunteer readers record chapters of books in the public domain. the recordings and audio files are then released onto the net. users have several different options to listen, from your workstation or downloaded onto a mobile device. the site is a totally volunteer, open source, free content, public domain project and anyone can volunteer to be a reader. librivox gets most of the texts from project gutenberg and the internet archive hosts their audio files. people\u2019s archive -- from the website, \u201cpeoples archive is dedicated to collecting for posterity the stories of the great thinkers, creators, and achievers of our time. the people whose stories you see on this site are leaders of their field, whose work has influenced and changed our world.\u201d the site includes videos from successful people in a range of careers (scientists, writers, filmmakers, and cinematographers), and documents how they got to where they are today \u2013 in their own words. all content is free, but they request a subscription, if you need to view the videos at a higher resolution. steven spielberg film and video archive at united states holocaust memorial museum -- this online catalog provides access to the united states holocaust memorial museum's steven spielberg film and video archive. the archive serves as a comprehensive informational and archival resource worldwide for moving image materials pertaining to the holocaust and related aspects of world war ii. their staff continue to locate, acquire, preserve, and document archival film footage from sources throughout the united states and abroad. some of these films are intensely personal and were gifted by families and individual donors. expert village american presidency project -- the american presidency project is the only online resource that has consolidated, coded, and organized into a single searchable database the presidential documents, papers, and an audio/video archive of presidential speeches. i hope you discover something interesting in the sites i\u2019ve mentioned. i am trying to learn more about these sites, as well as new ones, but they are very dense and the amount of multimedia content on the internet is growing quickly! to learn more about the resources available at the media center or if you have questions about these resources i\u2019ve mentioned, please feel free to contact me. i am always looking for interesting sites to review and welcome suggestions. i am especially interested in how faculty and students are using sites like these in their assignments and coursework. julie decesare digital media reference librarian

graduate scholarship in the 21st century after a year of careful planning, the bc libraries are now introducing an online system for submitting theses and dissertations. this new system, etd@bc (electronic theses & dissertations at boston college), will complement our traditional system of preserving paper copies of dissertations and theses in the university archives. the incremental benefits of electronic submission will be: faster dissemination of bc graduate scholarship easier access and discovery digital, as well as traditional preservation retention of the full quality of the \u201cborn-digital\u201d original inclusion of any multimedia components (video, audio, maps,...) in the original electronic theses and dissertations (etd) are being implemented at colleges and universities, both nationally and internationally. collaborative efforts are underway to aggregate this scholarship using digital networking technologies to make these theses and dissertations widely available. for example, the networked digital library of theses and dissertations (ndltd) is establishing a union catalog, whereby a single centralized portal will enable searching across institutions. boston college is also collaborating with the metaarchive cooperative to create a network of repositories for distributed digital preservation, which saves copies of etds in multiple repositories, separated geographically. access is still managed by the originating institution, but digital preservation becomes a collaborative activity. part of the graduate students' submission process involves an optional step of granting boston college permission to publish their dissertations and theses on bc\u2019s institutional repository, escholarship@bc , so that anyone with internet access will be able to find and download their scholarly work for free. clearly, with etds being disseminated far more widely, they will be cited more and have greater impact, thereby enhancing the student\u2019s research career as well as the research process itself. in addition, this widest diffusion possible of scholarship furthers a primary university mission, namely to share information as broadly as possible. this open access publication service is offered at no charge to bc students, and students retain their copyright. for those few theses and dissertations for which open access must be delayed, e.g. during a patent application or during submission to a journal publisher, students can request an embargo period. however, students are encouraged to check with prospective publishers before requesting embargoes; in many cases, they may discover that a prospective publisher does not consider a dissertation or thesis in an institutional repository to be an impediment to publication in their journal. the remaining part of the online submission by the student involves submitting the thesis/dissertation to the publisher proquest. proquest\u2019s submission system is conveniently organized into a step-by-step process; checkboxes keep track of progress. ample online help is provided in order to explain key issues, decisions, and actions such as: creating a pdf file that represents one\u2019s dissertation/thesis embedding fonts, so that in years to come the dissertation/thesis will display or print accurately formatting the title and abstract of the dissertation/thesis so that special characters/formatting are employed asking proquest to register the student\u2019s copyright obtaining permissions to incorporate any third-party copyrighted material into a dissertation/thesis as with any new system, the transition needs to be carefully planned and executed --- and there needs to be effective communication among the key shareholders. accordingly, the library is very keen to solicit feedback and suggestions from students, faculty, and administrators. the etd@bc website and the workshops will be upgraded based on this feedback. help will always be just an e-mail or a phone call away. bill donovan digital imaging librarian for further information about etd@bc, contact bill donovan at donovawf@bc.edu . for further information about

(e.g. file format) the nature of the course: the frequency with which it will be offered and the number of students involved. this is a relatively new field, and some vendors are not offering digital

tools attraction of google there have been few days over the past several years when i haven\u2019t used google to answer some query or to access some information. it\u2019s an extremely powerful tool whose results usually leave me satisfied. however, it is common to encounter students who believe that google is the sine qua non growing need of information literacy using the traditional library well was never particularly easy. it has now become even more challenging, the digital revolution, the information explosion, the resultant embarrassment of choice, and the myriad ways to access information combining to steer some students to easier avenues such as google. a remedy often adduced is the inculcation of \u201cinformation literacy,\u201d a quality defined by the american library association as being able to \"recognize when information is needed and hav[ing] the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.\" some canvass for a mandatory \u201cinformation literacy\u201d course for all undergraduates, though this is probably a contentious area best left as the topic of another article! nevertheless, most would agree that it is important that beginning researchers have a thorough understanding of the difference in quality between most of the resources readily accessible through google and those retrievable through bc libraries\u2019 hundreds of databases. this requires a solid grasp of how scholarship is published and disseminated, peer review, copyright, the economics of publishing, what is posted on the web and what is not, the open access movement and other related areas. an informationally literate student will readily realize why most serious research necessitates utilization of the libraries\u2019 subscription and purchased databases. at the same time, she will also understand that a vast amount of material potentially valuable for research is increasingly freely available on the web. google and other search engines should not be ignored by researchers. google scholar despite their fondness for google i suspect that many bc students do not utilize it as effectively as they might. how often is google\u2019s advanced searching capability utilized? how many click on google\u2019s more link which provides more focused searching by catalogs, directory, images, maps, finance, news, patents and a host of other options. do all students know of google scholar , a database of scholarly materials many of which are linked to bc\u2019s holdings. though it\u2019s not as focused as many subscription databases, google scholar scores highly on account of its size, breadth and great cross-disciplinary depth. the types of scholarly material it contains are greater than most other databases and include peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, abstracts and articles from academic publishers, professional societies, preprint repositories, universities and other scholarly organizations. google scholar may also include multiple versions of an article, possibly preliminary, which one may be able to access. one may also set one\u2019s searching preferences to bc libraries\u2019 holdings so that the findit@bc icon will be linked to results (click on scholar preferences to the right of the search box and then select boston college libraries (findit@bc) under library links ). it is particularly useful to consult the advanced scholar search tips in order to increase the accuracy and effectiveness of one\u2019s searches. google book search i also wonder how many use google book search , an initiative to digitize books from a growing number of major libraries (presently thirteen in the us, uk, spain and germany)? the potential number of books to be digitized is vast. for example, almost all of the university of michigan\u2019s over seven million volumes will be copied. of course, the full text of all books digitized by google will not be freely available to be read online, printed out, or downloaded. what one retrieves will depend on the book's copyright status. only digitized books in the public domain will be accessible full-text online. still, while google is reluctant to issue firm figures, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of books are already available full-text to anyone with internet access. though criticism has been aimed at the quality of some of the digitized images, google book search is already a potent research tool and one that should be known and utilized by students. google: not the only search engine i suspect that google is the most commonly used search engine. however, there are others, scores of others, including ask.com , scirus , clusty , smealsearch , live search , exalead , and of course yahoo! the top 100 alternative search engines, april 2007 ; 2) finding information: search engines ; 3) tool kit for the expert web searcher ; 4) search engine resources . selective web guides a strategy that may be useful to one struggling to conduct successful searches of the millions of web sites searched by google, yahoo and other search engines is to utilize what are often called \u201cselective web guides.\u201d these are categorized guides to web sites generally built and maintained by librarians and educators. the sites to which they link have been evaluated for accuracy and high quality content. some useful ones (there are many others) include: infomine infomine is a virtual library of over 100,000 web resources selected, annotated and indexed by librarians. resources include databases, e-journals, e-books, conference proceedings, bulletin boards, mailing lists, articles, directories of researchers, and many other types of information. intute intute, a free online service created by a network of uk universities and partners, provides \u201caccess to the very best web resources for education and research. subject specialists select and evaluate the websites in our

yeats family and mollie gill a showcase of rare artistic printed material from the cuala press -- which this year marks the 100th anniversary of its founding by elizabeth corbet yeats, sister of irish nobel laureate william butler yeats -- is on view for the first time in the united states at boston college's burns library of rare books and special collections through march 2009. \u00bb view slideshow the exclusive exhibit, titled \"sixty years of the cuala press: a collaboration of the yeats family and mollie gill,\" examines the contributions of the yeats family and the cuala press (pronounced \"cool-a\") to the irish struggle for a distinct cultural and political identity from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1970s. free and open to the public, the exhibit features selected pieces from burns library's extensive collection of cuala press cards, calendars, booklets, bookplates, broadsides and hand-colored prints, printing lists, embroidery designs, misprinted pages, photographs and other artifacts. also on display are works by famed poet and dramatist w.b. yeats -- who served as both editor and adviser for the press (which published over 70 books, including 30 of his own) -- and his brother, noted irish painter jack b. yeats. \"this is a wonderful exhibition because it has so many facets,\" said curator justine hyland of burns library. \"while much attention has been paid to the literary and artistic contributions of the yeats brothers, elizabeth yeats also played an important role in the irish renaissance -- the revitalization of culture that marked the turn of the 20th century in ireland -- by overseeing for more than 30 years a press distinguished not only for its specialization in the works of modern writers, but also for the fact that it was entirely run by irish women.\" cuala press writers included irish dramatist and folklorist lady gregory, who, with w.b. yeats co-founded the irish literary theatre and the abbey theatre; playwright and poet john synge, perhaps best known as author of the play \"the playboy of the western world\"; novelist and poet katharine tynan; critic and poet george russell, known as ae; frank o'connor, noted for his short stories and memoirs; oliver gogarty and, of course, the oldest yeats brother, william, who was instrumental in recruiting ireland's new literary talents. jack b. yeats illustrated many of the items, but the collection also includes illustrations by elizabeth c. yeats, ann price, mrs. jack b. yeats, lady glenavy, pamela coleman smith and emma duffin. the exhibition at burns library is largely drawn from bc's extensive mollie gill cuala press collection . mollie (or m\u00e1ire in irish) gill started working for cuala press in 1908 as an assistant to elizabeth yeats, hyland said, and she soon became its principal compositor. gill was an active participant in the irish republican movement, a charter member of ireland's cumann na mbann, or league of women, and an athlete who served as president of cumann cam\u00f3ga\u00edocht na ngael, the ruling body of camogie (a celtic team sport that is the women's equivalent of hurling), for eighteen years. she continued working for the cuala press until 1969 and was the longest serving employee of the firm. the gill collection contains not only cuala press books with mollie gill's name in the colophon (printer's mark), but also long, often complete, runs of extremely rare ephemeral pieces, including christmas cards, easter cards, bookplates, general cards and christmas booklets. the collection even includes mollie gill's personal manuscript catalogue of the cuala press publications and the picture \"fiddler playing for children\" by irish novelist and poet james stephens. after elizabeth yeats' death in 1940, w.b. yeats' wife bertha georgina yeats (known as \"george\"), with mollie gill and another assistant, kept the press running until 1946. \"this extraordinary collection was carefully maintained first by mollie gill and subsequently by loretta clarke-murray of ballina, co. mayo, ireland, who made the collection available to boston college,\" said burns library director robert k. o\u2019neill. combined with the library's already strong cuala holdings, the gill archive gives the burns library one of the most complete, beautifully preserved cuala press collections available anywhere, he said. the exhibit is supplemented by materials from the burns library's internationally-noted yeats collection, considered to be the most comprehensive in the world outside of ireland, including w.b. yeats' original poetical notebooks, letters from him to his sisters and father, and correspondence relating to the cuala press by elizabeth yeats. history of the cuala press while elizabeth c. yeats (1868\u20131940), who was known as lolly, was in her twenties, she lived with her family in the bedford park area of london, and was a successful kindergarten teacher and author of several manuals on brushwork. her older sister susan, known as lily, studied as an embroideress with may morris, who was the daughter of pre-raphaelite artist and writer william morris, a central figure in britain's arts and crafts movement. both worked to supplement the family's income, but when their mother died in 1900, they wished to return to ireland to live. in 1902, anglo-irish carpet designer evelyn gleeson gave the yeats sisters the opportunity not only to live in ireland again, but also to become part of the irish renaissance, when she invited them to join in her arts and crafts cooperative known as dun emer. there, lily oversaw the embroidery department and lolly, the printing press. the arts and crafts aesthetic of the yeats sisters \"had to do with doing things the long way, the hard way,\" said hyland. in contrast to the prevailing trend toward mechanized printing, for example, elizabeth chose to labor at a small, half-century hand-cranked albion press she'd procured through a newspaper ad. \"though many books are printed in ireland, book printing as an art has been little practised here since the 18th century,\" elizabeth wrote in the prospectus that accompanied the first volume she produced for dun emer -- a collection of poems by her brother william titled \"in the seven woods\" in 1903. \"[t]he press has been founded in the hope of reviving this beautiful craft.\" w.b. yeats praised the printing of \"in the seven woods,\" calling it \"the first book of mine that is a pleasure to look at . . . whether open or shut.\" in 1908, lolly and lily split from dun emer and set about starting their own business, cuala industries, comprised of an embroidery shop and a printing press. lolly named the press \"cuala,\" hyland said, because that is the old irish name for the geographic area south of dublin, now known as dundrum, where the cuala press had its headquarters for a number of years. the rest of the yeats family also contributed, including jack, who worked on design and drew illustrations, and george (bertha georgina), william's wife, who helped lily run the embroidery department, producing dresses and linens for ireland's wealthy. in addition to publishing books, elizabeth printed christmas and other holiday cards, calendars, pamphlets, and a periodical called \"a broadside,\" which featured poems, illustrations and music. throughout its 32 years under elizabeth's direction, cuala press maintained its strong irish identity: with the exception of american expatriate poet, critic and intellectual ezra pound and bengali writer and composer rabindranath tagore, cuala's writers were irish, and its works were printed on irish paper. in both good times and bad, elizabeth refused english patronage, even after ireland gained independence from britain. in a letter to william late in her life, she wrote, \"we ought to get someone irish if possible\" to pay off cuala's bills. but, she complained, \"no one here has a father who would put [3,000 pounds] into anything but guinness.\" after william and lolly died - in 1939 and 1940, respectively - william's wife, george, with mollie gill and another assistant, kept the press running until 1946. the cuala press's last book under george's management was \"stranger in aran,\" published that year, at which point she turned her attention to other endeavors and the press stopped printing books. cuala continued to create hand-colored cards and prints, however, and mollie gill continued to work there until 1969. though the burns library exhibit focuses on the 60 years from its founding in 1908 through the end of mollie gill's tenure, the cuala press did begin printing books again in 1969, when it was revived by w.b. yeats' son and daughter, michael and anne, and went on printing until the they no longer had time to run it, in the mid 1980s. the exhibit hints at later productions of the press (and at the dolmen press, which followed the typographical standards set by the cuala), and does include coverage of the press's revival in the 1970's. the mollie gill cuala press collection and the yeats collection at burns library are part of the boston college irish collection, considered to be the premier, most comprehensive collection of irish research material in the united states. the irish collection documents the history, life and culture of the irish people, and maintains strong holdings in irish history, religion and politics, as well as significant collections related to some of ireland's greatest writers, including one of the world's finest collection related to nobel laureate samuel beckett. for more information consult justine hyland, reference librarian, burns library, 617-552-4861, justine.hyland.1@bc.edu . questions,

space is limited in the burns library and there were many duplicate copies among the st. john's collection. as i was to find out, several libraries \u2013 the new hampshire state library among others \u2013 had donated their bound issues to st. john's when they were weeding their own collections. \"they'll be thrown away,\" i was told. when faced with that prospect, there is only one responsible reply \u2013 space or no space \u2013 for a rare book librarian to make. \"we'll take them.\" little, at that time, did i realize the momentousness of that decision. published from 1888 through 1918, the sacred heart review was a newspaper of roughly 16 pages per issue. edited by the rev. john o'brien, pastor of the sacred heart church in east cambridge, the paper was definitely not a church bulletin, but a full-fledged newspaper devoted to local, national and international news. the heart of the journal, however, comprised articles that reported on the catholic church in the archdiocese of boston as well as greater new england, along with pieces that explicated and defended catholicism. the statement on the paper's masthead puts it succinctly: our object: to furnish sound, instructive, and entertaining reading for the catholic family; to explain, illustrate, and defend the doctrines, devotion, and practices of the church. the first order of business was to inventory the masses of volumes that were delivered to the burns library, and since some of these bound volumes turned out to be in three-hole punched loose leaf, the only way to really know what we had was to go through each volume, issue-by-issue. the sacred heart review was published as two volumes per year, 26 issues to the volume. given the number of duplicates we had \u2013 in some cases there were five or six duplicates of a particular volume \u2013 the job appeared to be a very long and dry exercise in spreadsheet creation. but it was just that \"long and dry exercise\" that led directly to the review becoming a completely searchable digitized text. as i thumbed through each issue of each volume i began to be drawn into the newspaper's world \u2013 the world of turn-of-the-last-century boston. through the newspaper's advertisements, articles, columns and even printing presentation, i entered a paper time machine that became more and more compelling the more i cataloged. by the time i was finished i had become convinced that this journal would be an ideal addition to the greater digital library; only six libraries nation-wide had holdings of the review , and of these only three \u2013 bc, library of congress and marquette university \u2013 had complete holdings. what did i find that was so compelling? and how would the digitization of this newspaper advance scholarship? let me count the ways ... the front pages of the paper always covered current events in both the political and intellectual spheres; here is a tiny sampling of some of those articles: in vol. 53, no. 3 (jan. 2, 1915) the cover article contained pope benedict xv's encyclical ad beatissimi apostolorum , which described his grief at the slaughter that had just begun to envelope europe. terming the war the \"suicide of civilized europe,\" benedict attempted to mediate between the allies and the central powers, but was rejected by both sides. vol. 56, no. 17 (oct. 7, 1916) saw another front-page article concerning the war, entitled \"german-americans loyal.\" anti-german sentiment had become high in the country (for example, one man of german descent was lynched in illinois simply because of his ethnic background, and the jury appointed to try the case described the act as \"patriotic\"), but the review strongly defended the patriotism of its german-american parishioners and indeed of german-americans everywhere. \"a chinese priest martyred,\" found in vol. 31, no. 7 (feb. 13, 1904), describes not only the death of canadian priest, fr. andrew chu, who died a martyr's death whilst on mission in china, but the global reach of the church. an article entitled \"catholics and socialism,\" by the rev. m.p. dowling, found in vol. 41, no. 19 (may 1, 1909) gives a brief yet eloquent description of the church's stance on socialist ideology and on socialism's strengths and weaknesses. \"the theory of evolution,\" vol. 18, no. 5 (july 31, 1897), is a short yet surprisingly sophisticated analysis of that theory. as the paper's masthead stated, one of the purposes of the sacred heart review was to explicate and defend the theological positions of the catholic church. as such, every issue had articles that defended the church and catholics from misinformed or bigoted positions. in addition, every issue also featured articles by protestant theologians that viewed the church in a favorable light. examples of such articles: \"the non-sectarianism of amherst college. what an inquirer discovered about the obligation of attending protestant services,\" vol. 46, no. 14. (sept. 23, 1911), describes the supposedly non-sectarian services that all students attending amherst at the time had to attend and their clearly biased intent. the article consists of a series of letters between the registrar of amherst and the parent of a prospective jewish student from flagstaff, arizona, in which the distinctly denominational intent of the school is revealed. some early memories , published in scribner's magazine , to illustrate the bias with which protestant institutions teach the history of the catholic church. \"considerations on catholicism by a protestant theologian\" was a series of columns that ran in just about every issue the review ever published. for example, the column in vol. 34, no. 1 (july 1, 1905), was the 360th such column. these columns, often by the rev. charles c. starbuck of andover, mass., sought to redress popular protestant conceptions of the catholic church and place these arguments within an historical context. most issues of the review devoted at least some space to coverage of events in the archdiocese of boston, and some issues were devoted \u2013 in part or in whole, in the case of supplements \u2013 to reporting the affairs of the catholic church throughout greater new england. since the paper's period correlates to the rise of what some have called the \"golden age of american catholicism,\" it represents an extraordinarily rich resource with which to mine information about this period. the editor himself is given a seven-page spread in vol. 40, no. 1 (june 27, 1908)'s \"the successful celebration of father o'brien's triple anniversary.\" father o'brien was celebrating 40 years as a priest, being the founder of the sacred heart review , and being the editor of the paper for 20 years. \"the church in worcester\" (vol. 16, no. 13, sept. 26, 1896, supplement p. [1]-24), \"the catholic church in southwestern maine\" (vol. 16, no. 1, july 4, 1896, p. [19]-34), and \"the catholic church in the androscoggin and lower kennebec valleys\" (vol. 16, no. 7, august 15, 1896, supplement p. 1-16) represent just a few of the issues and/or supplements devoted to reportage on the activities of the church in greater new england. each article was replete with photographs of the churches involved (both interior and exterior views), portraits of the priests employed in each parish, and sometimes photographs of classes of attached parochial schools. one of the great figures in this period of boston religious history, cardinal o'connell \u2013 a bc graduate \u2013 is given front page coverage in \"the people rejoice with archbishop o'connell. celebration of his home-coming and his silver jubilee,\" vol. 42, no. 2 (july 3, 1909). since many of the subscribers to the newspaper were irish-americans, the review often featured articles and columns dealing with irish heritage. advertisements offering inexpensive rates to travel back to ireland were prominently featured, as were columns dealing with irish language and culture. \"our gaelic department,\" a column conducted by the rev. m.p. mahon that featured in many issues of the review , offered lessons in reading irish. see for example vol. 44, no. 3 (july 9, 1910). finally, popular culture is treated in every issue with the many advertisements that brought the review income. from the standpoint of both history and cultural studies the review offers many insights into this period of our history. it is possible to trace the rise and fall of gas lighting through the advertisements of the cambridge gas light company. towards that end the ads attempted to fend off the encroaching dominance of electric lighting by offering very inexpensive rates. every issue featured advertisements from local patent medicine manufacturers such as lydia pinkham's vegetable compound, dr. greene's nervura, father john's, and dr. pierce's pleasant pellets. see for example vol. 24, no. 26 (dec. 29, 1900) , and especially the full-page ad \"a cry for help\" purchased by the lydia e. pinkham medicine co., lynn, mass. in vol. 13 (n.s. 1), no. 12 (mar. 23, 1895). most of these firms disappeared or changed the nature of their products after the passage of the pure food and drug act; for example, dr. greene's was found to contain 18% alcohol, along with ginger, and the owners were fined. lydia pinkham's medicine, aimed at the reduction of menstrual cramps, was actually found to have genuine medicinal properties and the firm is still in business. songs have been written about pinkham, and a b-17 bomber in wwii was named \"lydia pinkham.\" the bomber, unfortunately, did not have the same luck as ms. pinkham\u2019s customers, and was shot down. the review itself advertised that it offered \"a first-class college education free to any boy who sends the shr offices 100 new subscriptions 4 years of either preparatory (high school) course, or 4 years of college course at boston college.\" similar offers were made for holy cross college and mt. st. joseph academy. see vol. 34, no. 2 (july 8, 1905). these short descriptions provide but an inkling as to the contents of this incredible resource, and thanks to the work of bill donovan, betsy mckelvey, brian meuse, naomi rubin, and greg tallent it will be possible to view, search and download the entire contents of this journal in either individual issue or complete volume form. the entire corpus of the sacred heart review will be available by summer of 2009, but a sample volume of what this will look like is available via the digital collections site .

library assessment studies indicate that most users begin their research with a search engine. we continue to improve our web presence, but we are aware that our website remains too dense and jargon laden, includes irritating hoops for the searcher to jump through, and presents resources in silos that in many cases are meaningful to librarians but not to users. too often users come to the catalog and the library web site for known-item searching, having already discovered what they are looking for somewhere else. while users typically give libraries high ratings for accuracy and trustworthiness of information, they rate search engines higher in terms of reliability, cost effectiveness, ease of use, convenience, and speed. ( see oclc report ) we need to do better. users do not distinguish initially by format and prefer that content be delivered electronically (in fact, many assume that all content will be delivered electronically). we observe users making quick decisions with their search results and not taking advantage of the rich metadata discussed in the previous article . they do not dig deep into the catalog records, look only at the brief displays, and expect results to be organized by relevance. this translates into their possibly missing appropriate and valuable titles. we realize that users want fast results and a seamless, transparent, and integrated discovery-to-delivery (d2d) process. users want interoperability. library systems must be easier to use so they will be thought of as a \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d in the discovery-to-delivery process. there need to be fewer steps and systems in searching library resources. a clich\u00e9 in the library field is that only librarians like to search; everyone else likes to find. the boston college libraries have a long-term interest in improving access for the searcher and addressing that demand for greater integration between the many products to which the library subscribes. work with federated-search (i.e. searching across databases simultaneously) technologies, context-sensitive linking (find it), digitool, and relationships with content providers are motivated by this spirit. with support from its, the libraries recently entered into agreement to collaborate on a product that could offer solutions to many of these vexing searching problems: primo . primo will offer library users a single, unified solution for the discovery and delivery of all local and remote scholarly information resources - including books, journals, articles, images, sound, video and other digital content. primo will provide users with up-to-date services and experiences in line with their expectation for quick and efficient discovery and delivery of what they need, where and when they need it. while separate library systems will still exist, primo provides a single point of entry that will represent results in a more useful context for the user. amazon and home depot for good examples from the commercial sector and the new catalog from north carolina state for an academic example. the facets available in these systems mine the metadata to create logical groupings of results for the user, such as sub-topic(s), format, genre, library location, time period, and language. (on a side note, these options will also be included in our soon to be released federated search service, crosssearch. put generally, crosssearch puts the choice of which databases to search simultaneously in the hands of the user. the approach combines searching and browsing). primo also incorporates a ranking scheme that orders search results according to relevancy and many ways to sort. primo will include dictionaries and thesauri to provide search suggestions and structured lists as part of the searching process. in continuing with the culture of experimentation the library is now a member of the primo charter members program \u2013 a leading group of organizations with the opportunity to collaborate on the development of primo. primo charter members include the college center for library automation (ccla), a consortium of 27 community colleges in florida; the cleveland museum of art; iowa state university; the university of iowa; and the university of east anglia. the charter members are part of a larger group that includes development partners vanderbilt university, the university of minnesota, hbz (the university library center of north-rhine westphalia, germany) and a danish consortium of research libraries under the aegis of danmarks elektroniske fag- og forskningsbibliotek (denmark's electronic research library that includes det kongelige bibliotek (the royal library), danmarks tekniske videncenter (the technical knowledge centre of denmark), aalborg universitet (aalborg university), and det administrative bibliotek (the danish administrative library)). you will hear more from us about this work. please feel free to contact ed tallent if you have any questions. ed tallent head, reference & instruction questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe to the boston college libraries newsletter", "hrefTitle": "Discovery And Delivery", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2007spring/"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "Boston College Libraries Newsletter", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2007spring/subject/index.html", "text": "boston college libraries newsletter volume 8 number 2 spring 2007 subject area highlight: social work social workers regularly deal with mental health issues on both a community level and with individual clients. for mental health related research, there is psychiatry online . produced by american psychiatric publishing, inc., this powerful new tool includes full-text access to the american journal of psychiatry, psychiatric services dsm library which includes the dsm-iv-tr , the dsm-iv-tr handbook of differential diagnosis , and representative case studies for psychiatric disorders. another new online tool is psycbooks . this is a full-text source of books and books chapters published by the american psychological association. psycbooks now has offerings from over 13,000 titles, including out-of-print titles. as part of the cambridge scientific abstracts package, psycbooks can be searched simultaneously with databases such as psycinfo and social services abstracts . the library has a broad range of resources for social workers and other researchers interested in public policy issues. an excellent starting point for this type of research is facts on file . this powerful tool includes a world almanac, an archive of news stories going back to 1940, country profiles, and an \u201cissues and controversies\u201d link on the upper right hand corner of the page. this link will bring you to an alphabetical listing of controversial contemporary issues. each profile of a controversy will present you with an outline and history of the issue in the united states. for journal articles on policy issues, there is pais international , and assia: applied social sciences index and abstracts kate silfen social work librarian please contact a social work librarian at swlib@bc.edu if we can offer you any assistance. questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe to the boston college libraries newsletter", "hrefTitle": "Subject Area Highlight", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2007spring/"}, {"classification": ["Social Sciences", "Education"], "title": "Getting Started with Theology/Theology & Ministry Research -

a sustained dramatic period in the first decade of the 20th century, one of collaboration and revision, and marked by the appearance of the nationalist play, cathleen ni houlihan (1902); and a final period in which his drama became more experimental, symbolic and esoteric. the early period has received the least critical attention, owing in part to the admittedly rudimentary style of this period's plays and to yeats's own misgivings over their aesthetic value. moreover, because the early plays have been described, not unfairly, as \"deeply conventional\" and \"utterly unirish,\" they are often overlooked in favor of his later work. 3 but these initial creative attempts reveal the influences that shaped his emerging poetic, and against which he reacted in his later work. title page, 1886. in mosada: a dramatic poem by w. b. yeats, dublin: sealy, bryers, and walker, 1886. each of yeats's early plays feature dominant female characters as magicians or enchanting temptresses wielding occult powers, and most were written before he had met maud gonne, said to be the muse for his mythologizing of women. vivien and time , the revised time and the witch vivien , the island of statues and mosada all portray heroines who are by turns sinister, beautiful, dangerous and cruel. love and death is no exception; its heroine, ginevra, callously murders her father and sister in pursuit of her immortal lover. in 1915, yeats confessed of his younger self, \"women filled me with curiosity and my mind seemed never long to escape from the disturbance of my senses, i was a romantic, my head full of the mysterious women of rossetti and those hesitating faces of [edward] burne-jones which seemed always anxious for some alastor at the end of a long journey.\" 4 the sense of unfulfilled desire to which yeats alludes is evident in his early poetry, too. female characters assume textual and symbolic significance, but where they are powerful and decisive in the verse drama, they are often dreamy, ethereal and sensuous in yeats's love lyrics. the context of desire and death remains the same, as does the theme of romantic and sexual frustration. yeats's lyric speakers are in thrall to the woman's beauty and at her mercy; she is enchanting but potentially dangerous in the power she wields over him. love and death , written in april 1884, when yeats was eighteen, receives only a glancing mention in his autobiography, reveries over childhood and youth (1915), but his description confirms that the play is of a piece with his other early drama: i was writing a long play on a fable suggested by one of my father's early designs. a king's daughter loves a god seen in the luminous sky above her garden in childhood, and to be worthy of him and put away mortality, becomes without pity and commits crimes, and at last, having made her way to the throne by murder, awaits his coming among her courtiers. one by one they become chilly and drop dead, for unseen by all but her, her god is in the hall. at last he is at her throne's foot and she, her mind in the garden once again, dies babbling like a child. 5 like the other plays from this period, love and death features an otherworldly setting and a powerful female protagonist, whose death is dramatized as the play's inevitable climax. class and gender divisions are clear, but the characters exist in a world free from economic concerns. male characters, like king ralph, ginevra's father and the king, are weak compared to the women, who exercise control over the men. just as he would elegize women in later lyrics, yeats here introduces the trope of the female protagonist's death; but unlike the love elegies, in which the male speaker describes the female beloved's death, ginevra \"narrates and performs both her claim to power and her death, speaking until language meets mortality.\" 6 ireland is conspicuous for its absence from this and other early plays, but when yeats did begin to dramatize his nation, he returned to mythic and symbolic female characters and to the tension between power and mortality. 1. w.b. yeats, \"i became an author,\" in uncollected prose by w. b. yeats 2: reviews, articles and other miscellaneous prose, 1897-1939 , ed. john p. frayne (new york: columbia university press, 1975), 507. 2. bernard o'donoghue, \"yeats and the drama,\" the cambridge companion to w.b. yeats , eds. marjorie howes and john kelly (cambridge: cambridge university press, 2006), 106. 3. r.f. foster, w.b. yeats: a life;

one that was \"politically engaged, and demanded a politicized, as well as an aesthetic, response from its audiences\" \u2013 sparking a debate over the role and value of art in the very period yeats began writing. 3 this new drama was often censored for its subjects and themes and for challenging the conventions of the commercial victorian theatre. some of the period's plays staged femininity in objectionable or controversial ways, contributing to the phenomenon of the new woman. the new woman challenged victorian norms of gender and domesticity, and she became a recurring feature in the period's drama, prose and journalism. the fin de si\u00e8cle then marks a period of \"new beginnings, but also one whose movements are defined by the extent to which they developed away from their victorian roots, and transformed them in the light of the cultural and political possibilities of the period.\" 4 that yeats made his first tentative efforts as a dramatist and poet at a moment when the social role of art was contested, and when literature itself reflected and catalyzed the period's controversies, is significant for our interpretation of this early work. his own evolving ideas about the value of art, the pursuit of beauty in his work, and the role of the artist have roots in the period's debates, and his juvenilia reflects these concerns. 1. gail marshall, \"introduction,\" the cambridge companion to the fin de si\u00e8cle , ed. gail marshall (cambridge: cambridge university press, 2007), 3. 2. oscar wilde, \u201clecture to art students,\u201d essays and lectures (rockville, md: arc manor, 2008), 98. 3. marshall, 4. 4. ibid, 5. \u00a9 2011 boston college libraries", "hrefTitle": "Literary Landscape", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/sites/libraries/loveanddeath/"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Love and Death, W.B.

the death is meant only to prolong the bittersweet yearning for the beloved, which if fulfilled, would cease to have as strong a hold over the poet who voices this desire. yeats returned to the liebestod time and again in his poetry and drama, including the early verse plays, linking love and death often as a means of negotiating his unrequited feelings for maud gonne. according to cullingford, yeats associated sexual passion with annihilation and consoled himself with the thought that gonne would be accessible to him in death: \"the dead woman, unlike the living one, can be imaginatively possessed forever: she is incapable of change or self-assertion. love poetry, like elegy, frequently feeds on the obliterated subjectivity of the person who occasions it.\" 3 cullingford cautions us again reading yeats's poetry in too narrow a biographical context by linking his use of the liebestod with his ongoing pursuit of gonne. indeed, the frequent association of love and death in yeats's work is evident even to the casual reader, and it provides a lens for interpreting the early verse drama. like percy bysshe shelley, whose poetry the young yeats deliberately imitated, the quest for love in nearly all of yeats's early plays ends in death \u2013 the death of the lover, the death of the beloved, or in the case of love and death , the death of everyone on stage in the final scene. this is a pattern that yeats borrowed from shelley's alastor . in george bornstein's words, \"earthly love alone does not satisfy either the shelleyan or the yeatsian lover, who longs for ideal completion.\" 4 the impossibility of satisfying his (or her) desire leads the lover to accept, even embrace death as a compensation and an escape. george frederic watts, love and death , 1897. oil on canvas, 283 x 150 cm. tate britain, london. this is evident in love and death in ginevra's suicidal pursuit of sintram, an immortal \"spirit hunter,\" whom no human can behold. after witnessing the deaths of her companions in the final scene, ginevra beseeches her lover to remain with her \u2013 to draw closer, although she knows his presence will ensure her own death. her final words and yeats's closing stage directions, consistent with the liebestod , imply that ginevra is joined with sintram in death. she pleads, \"come we will go / \u2026we will together go,\" and her death is indicated when the phantom fades. reversing the gender roles of yeats's later love lyrics, the play features a woman who is by turns lovesick \u2013 occupying the role usually reserved for the male poet \u2013 and sinister and murderous. ginevra exercises control over the men in the play, murdering her father, king ralph, and thwarting moscon's attempts to avenge alice's death. but as if he is threatened by this display of female power, yeats dramatizes her death, allowing her to narrate the process until the end. elizabeth brewer redwine notes, \"yeats brought this trope into his poems as well, but his love elegies contain only his own speech; the speaker in the poems is the courtier/lover describing the woman's death.\" 5 the liebestod works on two levels in the play: first, the female protagonist and her immortal lover presumably consummate their love in death; but on a second level, the playwright dramatizes the death of his heroine, curtailing her power and fixing her in place in a move that parallels the male poet's desired \"possession\" of his dead female beloved. the conventional balance of power is restored, and in these final lines, we witness perhaps yeats's earliest exploration of the love-death link. 1. quoted in elizabeth butler cullingford, \"the liebestod ,\" gender and history in yeats's love poetry (syracuse: syracuse university press, 1996), 43. 2. ibid., 44. 3. ibid., 46. 4. george bornstein, yeats and shelley (chicago: university of chicago press, 1970), 19. 5. elizabeth brewer redwine, \"'she set me writing my first play': laura armstrong and yeats's early drama,\" irish university review 35.2 (autumn-winter 2005), 254. \u00a9 2011 boston college libraries", "hrefTitle": "Liebestod", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/sites/libraries/loveanddeath/"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Love and Death, W.B.

1819. in finden's landscape & portrait illustrations to the life and works of lord byron , volume 2, london: john murray, 1832. w.b. yeats & the romantics chief among yeats's early influences was the work of the english romantic poets. indeed, yeats acknowledged in retrospect that percy bysshe shelley had shaped his life, providing him with a model for the poetry he hoped to write and the poet he sought to become. as an adolescent, the aspiring poet imitated shelleyan heroes, and when he began to write, he borrowed shelley's interest in death and magic, his symbolism, his intellectual vision, even his language. yeats's early drama is written in the lofty rhetoric of the english romantic poets, and his heroes are solitary byronic figures. even when he later rejected shelley's style and philosophy, writing essays that faulted the romantic poet for many of the flaws of yeats's own early verse, yeats's work still bore the traces of shelley's influence. 1 george bornstein describes the poet as \"a lifelong if sometimes ambivalent romantic,\" one who consistently interrogated and re-fashioned his romanticism, coupling a romantic impulse with the modernist drive to \"make it new.\" 2 for yeats, this period's poets \u2013 blake, wordsworth, coleridge, byron, shelley and keats \u2013 constituted a pantheon of writers he admired, imitated and reacted against throughout his career. yeats's devotion to shelley, in particular, developed early and was owing to his father's influence. john b. yeats encouraged his son to study narrative prose and verse in the romantic tradition; and yeats's friendship with edward dowden, a professor of english literature at trinity college and the foremost shelley scholar of his time, also stimulated his interest in the romantic poet and his desire to imitate shelley's style and subjects. yeats was not alone in aspiring to write verse drama and narrative in this vein. the influence of the romantic poets was in fact pervasive in his intellectual circle; many of his classmates, also aspiring writers, adhered to romantic conventions and sought to emulate them in their writing. he recalls, \"the first attempt at serious poetry i made was when i was about seventeen and much under the influence of shelley. it was a dramatic poem, about a magician who set up his throne in central asia, and who expressed himself with queen mab-like heterodoxy. it was written in rivalry with g\u2014. i forget what he wrote.\" 3 luigi schiavonetti after thomas phillips, portrait of william blake , 1805. in life of william blake by alexander gilchrist, london: macmillan and company, 1880. yeats's early verse drama betrays his enthusiasm for the romantic poets in its choice of subjects, its themes and its language. the plays from this period all feature exotic settings, magic spells, mesmerizing and often powerful women, lovers thwarted in pursuit of the beloved, and a deliberate linking of love, death and magic. adele dalsimer notes the influence of spenser, too, in the \"pastoral landscape[s], peopled by timid shepherds and shepherdesses, gentle hunters, and fairies,\" and in the plays' diction. 4 yeats's use of sensory adjectives and hyphenated adjectival phrases echo shelley's poetry, as does his vocabulary and imagery and the synesthesia of his descriptions. in love and death , for example, yeats borrows heavily from shelley's poetry: the words \"pale,\" \"dew,\" \"wandering\" and \"maiden\" recur, as do images of fire (red sunsets), stars, fountains and lush landscapes. 5 the romantic influence is evident, too, in the fantastic plots of the early plays, which link love and death. the protagonist's quest for love often ends in his or her demise, as it does in this unpublished play, when ginevra's desire to behold her immortal love destroys her. this blending of earthly and otherworldly spheres and the inclusion of magic reflects the poet's urge to escape from reality, and again owes a debt to shelley, in whose work magic was often a theme. although yeats isolated shelley as the poet who had the greatest influence on him, he acknowledged, too, a debt to blake \u2013 and later in life, claimed that it was blake, not shelley, who had the profounder effect on him. from blake, yeats borrowed the idea of contraries \u2013 the notion that opposing pairs generated an energy that led to progress or forward movement. contraries abound in yeats's poetry: good and evil, young and old, art and nature, and body and soul, among others. as his poetry evolved, he retained his devotion to romanticism, often describing himself as one of the \"last romantics,\" but he remade the tradition to fit his growing interest in irish folklore and nationalism. as bornstein attests, reconciling shelley's idealism with life in modern ireland posed a challenge, and this is perhaps one of the reasons that yeats's early verse drama is set in alternate worlds with exotic, often magical characters. 6 whatever he preserved or consciously discarded from his early work, yeats's devotion to romanticism survived in some form in his later poetry \u2013 be it in his language, his imagery, his understanding of the poet's role \u2013 and we would do well to see the germ of his mature work in these early plays. 1. see george bornstein, \"yeats and romanticism.\" the cambridge companion to

burns library at boston college has substantially increased its already impressive collection related to the history of the society of jesus. these recent acquisitions came to the library through purchases from the weston jesuit school of theology in cambridge, massachusetts and from the library of the french province of the jesuits located at les fontaines in chantilly outside paris. since 1999 marks two anniversaries of great significance in the history of the society of jesus, it provides an excellent occasion for an exhibit including books from these new additions to the collection. one of these anniversaries relates to the spiritual exercises of saint ignatius of loyola, the founder of the society of jesus; the other relates to the jesuits' educational enterprise and, thence, to their scholarship across a wide range of disciplines. commitment to fostering religious devotion and to promoting formal schooling shaped the profile of the society from its foundational years through the subsequent centuries, giving it the basic elements of what st. ignatius called its \"way of proceeding\" or what we might call its style. st. ignatius underwent as a soldier a deep religious conversion while recuperating in 1521 from wounds he suffered in the battle of pamplona. as his relationship with god developed over the next year or so, he began writing down what he was experiencing in order to help himself and also to help others who approached him in order \"to converse about the things of god.\" these were the origins of the spiritual exercises , on which ignatius continued to work for the next two decades. although more often cited than studied, the exercises were destined to become one of the world's most famous books. the exercises encapsulated the essence of ignatius's own spiritual conversion from conventional christianity to a deep awareness of god's presence and comfort in all of the circumstances of his life, and it presented this experience in a form that would guide others to analogous changes of awareness and motivation. not a book of spiritual teachings as such, it was rather a design for a process of prayer, meditation, and discernment that would, as ignatius said, \"allow the creator to deal directly with the creature, and the creature directly with the creator.\" a call to inwardness, it was the first christian book to provide such a full, clear, yet remarkably flexible program, and it thus created what came to be known as the \"retreat,\" a few days, a week, or a month of seclusion set aside in order to open oneself to god's will. the exercises were intended for christians from all walks of life but had special relevance for members of the society in that they set the pattern, goals, and style for all of the ministries in which the jesuits engaged. the importance of the book in establishing the ethos and spirit of the society of jesus cannot be overestimated. when in the 1530s ignatius studied philosophy and theology at the university of paris, he guided a number of persons in the exercises , including six of his fellow-students who, as a result of the experience, formed with him the first nucleus of what would in 1540 officially become the society of jesus. the book of the exercises is what gave this initial group its cohesion, and it was an instrument that they used from the beginning in their efforts to help others find their spiritual way and, in some cases, to enter the nascent society. the book circulated in manuscript among members of the society until it was finally published in rome by the printer antonio blado in 1548. ignatius wanted it published for several reasons: to assure a more accurate text, to increase its circulation among jesuits, and to put it in a form that could receive papal approval. the last reason was crucial because the book was being attacked in some quarters as dangerous and even heretical. in any case, the publication launched the exercises into the world beyond ignatius's immediate disciples and began a remarkable printing history that continues to this day, with translations into practically every language around the globe. the book has had an immense impact on the history of catholic devotion, an impact that continues up to the present. it has also influenced areas of culture in unexpected ways. with its promotion of the use of the imagination in meditation, for instance, it influenced painters and sculptors, and it helped create the genre of emblem books, with their fusion of symbol and meditation. one of the most innovative and distinctive aspects of the exercises was that individuals did not undertake them on their own but with the help of another person, who acted as guide, companion, senior partner, or simply helper. st. ignatius in fact intended the book more for this person than for those actually making the retreat. in the book he gave the person a number of suggestions about how those making the exercises might be guided most fruitfully and about dealing with the different circumstances that might arise. early on, this person began to be referred to as the director of the exercises . this was somewhat of a misnomer, given the more mediating role described in the book, but it became standard. st. ignatius trained some of the early jesuits for this delicate role in informal ways, so that a demand grew for him to write down some further indications as to how it was to be performed. ignatius left a few notes, as did some of the jesuits he trained, but many jesuits came to believe that something fuller and more systematic was needed, a \"directory.\" ignatius's two successors as superior general promoted the idea, but the next general, everard mercurian (1571-1580), pushed it forward by himself, composing a draft and successfully requesting another from juan alfonso de polanco, one of ignatius's closest assistants. the next general, claudio acquaviva (1581-1615), was finally able to bring the project to completion through further drafts and consultations. it turned out to be a relatively small book that tried to distill reflections resulting from pastoral experience, for the most part simply elaborating on suggestions already in the exercises . thus in 1599 the official directory was published, another landmark in the history of catholic devotion. it meant that the exercises had achieved almost canonical status. this directorium exercitiorum spiritualium p. n. ignatii , reprinted innumerable times and translated into a number of languages, was never revised nor has it ever officially been replaced, which is a tribute to its accomplishment. in the past thirty years, however, a number of commentaries on the exercises have appeared that have made it less useful than it once was. scholars correctly describe the society of jesus as the first teaching order in the catholic church insofar as the jesuits were the first ever to undertake the founding, management, and staffing of schools as a formal ministry. in the long history of the jesuits, few activities seem more characteristic of them. it comes as somewhat of a surprise to learn, therefore, that when the society came into being in 1540, such an undertaking was not in the purview of the founding members. in fact, graduates of the university of paris though they all were, they decided that they would not undertake any teaching assignments anywhere except on a temporary, short-term basis. it certainly never occurred to them that they would end up running schools. they saw themselves primarily as itinerant catechists, preachers, and evangelists. saint francis xavier, one of the original companions of ignatius in paris, was on his way to india as a missionary even before the society received its papal charter in 1540. within a few years, however, jesuits began giving some instruction to young recruits, and bit by bit their reputation as pedagogues grew. they had, moreover, begun to see the benefits of labors sustained with the same group of people over a long period of time. the stage was being set for a new commitment, but we know this only in hindsight. it was certainly not clear to them at the time. the curtain rose with incredible suddenness and the action took off with incredible speed. in 1547, scarcely a half-dozen years after the founding of the society, st. ignatius received an utterly unexpected and unsolicited invitation from leading citizens of the city of messina in sicily to found and staff a secondary school for their sons. he accepted, which indicates that his own thinking was already changing. the school opened the next year and, though plagued with many problems, was a great success. a momentous turning-point had been reached in the history of the society of jesus. that same year, thirty members of the senate in palermo, impressed by what was happening in messina, petitioned ignatius for a similar school. again he acquiesced. other schools soon followed -- in 1551 schools opened in both vienna and rome. by the time ignatius died in 1556, the jesuits were operating some thirty schools, practically all of them secondary, and just a few years later polanco would write in the name of the new general to inform jesuits that education had become the primary ministry of the society. meanwhile the school in rome, the \"roman college,\" had developed into a university, and, while secondary schools would always be far more numerous, other institutions of higher learning would henceforth be an important part of the jesuit enterprise. by 1773, the year that the society of jesus was suppressed throughout the world by papal edict, the jesuits were operating more than eight hundred universities, seminaries, primary, and secondary schools around the globe. the world had never seen before, nor has it seen since, such an immense network of educational institutions operating on an international basis under a single aegis. as the schools proliferated in the early decades, questions about curriculum, pedagogy, textbooks, administrative procedures, and similar matters began to be asked with greater urgency. an overarching issue was how these many schools could maintain some coherence among themselves. this was important for a number of reasons, not least of which was the necessity for jesuits being moved from one school to another to fit into the new institutions to which they had been transferred. how, furthermore, could a certain quality-control be established, with standards against which performance might be measured? ger\u00f3nimo nadal, one of ignatius's closest collaborators. was also the founder and first rector of the school in messina. he drew up the curriculum along lines in accord with those promoted by renaissance humanists, and this became, along with some of nadal's other writings, the first, somewhat indistinct, blueprint for the schools that were springing up everywhere. but chaos sometimes reigned. just after the school opened in vienna, ignatius complained that it was offering a mishmash of courses, without plan or meaning. bit by bit, some order was imposed, but jesuit educators increasingly requested a document, a comprehensive \"plan of studies\" that they could use as a guide. a number of attempts were made in succeeding decades to come up with such a plan, but none of the versions was found to be fully satisfactory. as with the directorium in exercitia spiritualia , it was claudio acquaviva who was able to bring this long-standing project to completion and officially publish in 1599 the ratio studiorum that became the magna carta of jesuit education. in the middle ages, the augustinians had a document known as ratio studiorum , and other orders had similar documents which were intended for the training of members of the orders. the ratio of the jesuits was different in that it was meant as much for the education of lay students as for jesuits, but it also was different because the \"plan of studies\" now included the humanities -- literature, history, drama, and so forth -- as well as philosophy and theology, the traditionally clerical subjects. this meant that the jesuit ratio assumed that literary or humanistic subjects could be integrated into the study of professional or scientific subjects; that is, it assumed that the humanistic program of the renaissance was compatible with the scholastic program of the middle ages. the ratio had all of the benefits and all of the defects of such codifications; while it set standards, for instance, it discouraged innovation. in any case, it had impact far beyond jesuit institutions because it was seen as a coherent and lucid statement of ideals, methods, and objectives shared broadly by educators in early modern europe. for the society of jesus, the ratio studiorum symbolized a certain maturing in its commitment to education, which had great repercussions for the future of catholicism. the schools were often at the center of the culture of the towns and cities where they were located: typically, they would produce several plays or even ballets per year, and some maintained important astronomical observatories. the commitment to education effected a profound change in the model of the society of jesus from what ignatius and his companions originally envisaged. it meant that the model of itinerant preachers of the gospel had to be tempered by the reality of being resident schoolmasters. it meant the development of large communities needed to staff the schools, it meant other things as well. perhaps most profoundly, it meant a special relationship to culture in that the society as an institution had a systematic relationship to \"secular\" learning, for its members had to be prepared to teach both the classics of latin and greek literature of the humanistic tradition (homer, virgil, cicero, and terence, for example) and the scientific texts of aristotle in the scholastic tradition (we must remember that \"philosophy\" meant to a large extent \"natural philosophy,\" subjects we call biology, physics, and astronomy). if jesuits were to teach these subjects, they would also almost perforce begin to write about them, at least to the point of producing textbooks for their students. at the beginning of the society, st. ignatius and the other jesuits, graduates of paris though they were, did not consider the writing of books in the purview of their mission; within a decade, ignatius mentioned in the jesuit constitutions the possibility of \"writing books useful for the common good.\" few such books were produced, however, until the number of schools began to grow and the need for appropriate and inexpensive textbooks felt. with textbooks in view, ignatius in the last year of his life went to immense trouble to secure a good press for the roman college, which was installed and in good working order within a few months of his death. among the first books published by this first press operated by the jesuits was andr\u00e9 des freux's edition of martial's epigrams (1558) -- a book by a \"pagan.\" within two generations, jesuits were producing books on a great scale, a phenomenon that would come to characterize the order. many of these were textbooks or at least related directly to instruction in the jesuit classrooms, but others ranged far more broadly and began to touch on almost every imaginable subject. the experience of the jesuit missionaries in exotic places like japan, china, and viet nam gave, when viewed largely, an extraordinarily cosmopolitan cast to this production. it is highly probable that even without the schools, the jesuits would have produced a significant number of books, for their counterparts in other religious orders did so. however that may be, the incontrovertible fact is that the schools provided the impetus for an extraordinarily copious production. they also required that the scope of that production be consistently and predictably wide-ranging, for the schools took the jesuits into just about every conceivable aspect of human culture and made them reflect upon it and come up with something to say. copyright the trustees of boston college boston college, 140 commonwealth avenue, chestnut hill, ma 02467", "hrefTitle": "Introduction", "refURL":

[\u2026] all must be an idealization of speech, and at some moment of passionate action or somnambulistic reverie. i remember his saying that all contemplative men were in a conspiracy to overrate their state of life, and that all writers were of them, excepting the great poets. 1 j.b. yeats hoped to foster in his son an appreciation of beauty and its expression in poetry \u2013 to refine his artistic sensibilities via an understanding of romantic poetry. the early verse drama betrays yeats's devotion to the romantic tradition and to percy bysshe shelley, in particular. before he had turned twenty, yeats had written a series of sketches and fragments \"in imitation of shelley and of edmund spenser, play after play \u2013 for my father exalted dramatic poetry above all other kinds \u2013 and i invented fantastic and incoherent plots.\" 2 although these early pieces were, by his admission, derivative and lacking skill, they mark yeats's first attempts to define his style, even if it was one he would later reject. jack b. yeats, returning from the bathe, mid-day , 1948. oil on canvas, 61.5 x 91.8 cm. crawford art gallery, cork. j.b. yeats's influence extended beyond literature, too. his father's financial uncertainty precipitated yeats's many moves as a child, his mother's emotional withdrawal, and his parents' marital estrangement. beyond this, yeats mentioned on more than one occasion his father's dominant personality, and the challenge he faced in adolescence of asserting his own identity in the face of this powerful intellectual presence. w.b. sought to distinguish himself in part by refuting his father's religious skepticism and embracing nationalism. j.b. yeats had revolted against victorian values, compelling his son to adopt a conservative, counter-revolutionary stance. his father's rationalism and positivism in fact provided a counterpoint to the dreamy, ethereal themes in much of w.b. yeats's early work. and it was not until his twenties that the young poet turned to ireland and irish nationalism as subjects for his writing. when he did, yeats borrowed some of the same imagery, language and dramatic tensions that originated in his juvenilia, confirming its significance to his entire body of work. 1. w.b. yeats, the autobiography of william butler yeats (new york: macmillan publishing company, 1965), 42. 2. ibid., 43. \u00a9 2011 boston college libraries", "hrefTitle": "Young Yeats", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/sites/libraries/loveanddeath/"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Love and Death, W.B.

the cornell yeats volumes. the entire manuscript of yeats's unpublished play, love and death , which he composed in 1884, totals five notebooks, some of which contain loose-leaf inserted papers. the play is significant for being the first written by yeats. it has never before been published or performed. yeats composed it in the same year that he began writing mosada and the island of statues , his earliest published plays. love and death is valuable, in part, for the light it sheds on the poet's other work from this period. the content of all five notebooks has been scanned in full and the use of facsimiles made possible by the burns library at boston college. the transcription includes a full draft of the play and yeats's partial revisions. his corrections, cancellations and occasional spelling errors are included. the work presented here will be of interest to yeats scholars, particularly those studying the poet's juvenilia, to scholars of irish literature, and to a general public

librarians, provides research sources, strategies, and support to the boston college community. individual guides cover broad subject areas, specific topics, and general research techniques. there are four basic ways to access individual libguides: select by subject category from the boston college libraries' website; click on a tag or search from the libguides @bc home page; browse an alphabetical

first-adopters of the primo system, which is the system that drives super sleuth. what is super sleuth , and what does it have to offer our users? users expect quick, easy and effective searching and retrieval of information and this is an attempt to be a one-stop solution for the discovery and delivery of local and remote resources, such as books, journal articles, and digital objects. currently, users often have to search separate systems to find the information they need. web 2.0 services super sleuth also adds \"web 2.0\" type features to the search interface. web 2.0 refers to a second generation of internet-based services - such as social networking sites, wikis, communication tools, and folksonomies - that let people collaborate and share information online in ways previously unavailable. fundamentally, web 2.0 acknowledges that users add value to the data provided by a given system. in this spirit, super sleuth adds web 2.0 interactivity to the catalog: the search results can be refined by using facets built on the fly by the system users can add their own tags to records users can create reviews and comments on records users are offered a google-like \"did you mean?\" alternative when potential misspellings in search terms are found users can push records/search results to connotea http://www.connotea.org/ and to del.icio.us http://del.icio.us/ google scholar finally, a reminder about google scholar , which was mentioned in the summer 2007 newsletter. the libraries have made their e-journal holdings available to google scholar, so that google presents accurate findit@bc links with your search results. to take advantage of this, you must set your google scholar preferences (click on scholar preferences to the right of the search box and then select

number 1 fall 2007 from illuminated manuscripts to instant messages: seeking balance in library technology there is an interesting tension playing out in my mind after having attended a professional seminar on library 2.0 (the library in the era of virtual communication technology): if we aim to excel as a library, offering our patrons the best services possible for electronic discovery and access to academic resources, does that mean we must keep neck and neck with the rapid advance of new communication technologies in the internet 2 market to succeed? certainly, we must not lose sight of the utility of new technology for libraries, and for scholarship itself. yet, adding layers of new bells and whistles to the basic bookshelf can sometimes only distract patrons from the real content of ideas, if they come to master \u201cgeek-speak\u201d instead of poetry. many of the advantages of internet 2 -- like blogs, wikis, podcasts and virtual worlds \u2013 clearly make mass communication more streamlined and efficient, more participatory and asynchronous. the rising generations of thinkers use im and chat, myspace and high-tech cell phones as if it were second nature. but is our goal to enable better rapid communication skills, or better thinking skills? we all know the epithet \u201crushing off to meditation\u201d! the wisdom of rapid communication for vital scientific experimentation is self-evident. but the wisdom of speed reading yeats is not. libraries and patrons need to distinguish the means from the ends. speedy research methods may free up the patron to handle reading and writing their texts with more devotion. alternately, a culture of speedy research may inculcate a culture of speedy reflection, of quantity at the expense of quality. a good point of balance is still to ever focus on the patron. patrons deserve the simplest, most streamlined, and clear avenue to the resources they need to fulfill their academic goals. these resources include not only books, electronic databases and journals, and digital repositories for other scholarly media. these resources also include the professional guidance and service of librarians, administrators and staff to build, maintain and advance a high-tech infrastructure. we must keep our essential hardware and security infrastructure up-to-date, as well as the suite of applications offered for discovery and access to our electronic and physical collections. but there is perhaps certain wisdom in remaining conservative with just how quickly libraries invest their resources to keep pace with the market. new virtual communications fads come and go. reliance upon proprietary vendors risks losing support when products terminate. hardware investments become obsolete fast. one thing is clear about the impact the internet has had on libraries: there is more need for libraries and librarians to take on the role of teacher for our patrons, in order to best help them navigate the complex labyrinth of information sources available today. so perhaps the discussion of resources comes down to a question of priorities: what are our scientific and humanist priorities as we shape the future of our academic libraries? i once had a trigonometry teacher who taught us we should never use calculators if we want to grow to learn to engineer them. similarly, if we rely on technology to do all our research, we may miss the opportunity to fully shape the way our research shapes ourselves. what do you think? we would like to know. michael creedon digital media specialist mike

\u201cmy love is in america.\u201d organized by visiting ethnomusicology professor dr. m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 s\u00failleabh\u00e1in, the festival generated great interest across campus and throughout the international irish music community. featuring 16 top fiddle performers living in the u.s., the festival\u2019s program of music, lectures, liturgy, and dance brought the rich irish fiddle tradition of north america into focus. the festival\u2019s artistic success spurred boston college to expand existing programs and library collections, augmenting the study of irish culture that had been in place for many years. the audio cd from the 1990 festival, my love is in america , captures highlights from the final concert. produced by dr. m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 s\u00failleabh\u00e1in, the recording received recognition from the library of congress american folklife center. dr. \u00f3 s\u00failleabh\u00e1in also conducted oral history interviews of the senior musicians during the festival weekend, and arranged that these interviews be videotaped for boston college. to create a lasting legacy of irish music on campus, dr. \u00f3 s\u00failleabh\u00e1in used the master audio and video recordings from the entire weekend to help inaugurate an irish music archives at the john j. burns library of rare books and special collections. renamed the irish music center in 1998, the irish music archives at the john j. burns library has grown to include rare and unique items in many formats, such as vintage sound recordings, music manuscripts, photographs, correspondence, and more. its collections, many of which have been generously donated, include materials from philip mcniff, s\u00e9amus connolly, comhaltas ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed \u00e9ireann/north america, david r. burke, george madaus, myron bretholz, the michael cummings collection of p.s. gilmore, thomas garvey, the hanafin family, may mullins, and the frederick m. manning collection of john mccormack. the burns library irish music center has received invaluable assistance over the years from sullivan artist-in-residence s\u00e9amus connolly. a ten-time all-ireland fiddle champion, mr. connolly has facilitated numerous donations to the archives, and has donated much of his own personal collection to the library. from his arrival on campus in 1990 as a featured performer and festival co-organizer, mr. connolly\u2019s wide-ranging contributions to irish music on campus have inspired students and built an international name for boston college among irish musicians. the gaelic roots festival that mr. connolly created here from 1993 to 2003 drew over 300 students from around the world, for a week each june, to listen and learn from internationally-acclaimed artists. since his artist-in-residence appointment in 2004, mr. connolly has continued public programming through the gaelic roots music song, dance, workshop and lecture series that runs throughout the academic year. the series brings traditional musicians, dancers, teachers, and lecturers to campus, at venues such as connolly house and gasson hall. most events are free of charge and are recorded for the burns library irish music center archives. in addition to attending public concerts, dances, and lectures, boston college students take advantage of academic courses offered by ethnomusicologist dr. ann morrison spinney (music) and by visiting scholars such as nyu folklorist dr. mick moloney (john j. burns library visiting scholar, fall 2004). students also participate in performance courses offered

recent years many humanities scholars have been concerned by the crisis in scholarly publishing. this crisis revolves about the dramatic decrease in the number of humanities monographs being purchased by libraries, the financial difficulties faced by many university presses, the increasing challenges faced by junior scholars in the humanities getting a manuscript accepted by a prestigious publisher. in december 2006 the modern language association issued the lengthy report mla task force on evaluating scholarship for tenure and promotion [pdf]. a primary charge of the task force was \u201cto examine current standards and emerging trends in publication requirements for tenure and promotion in english and foreign language departments in the united states.\u201d the charge was clearly a response to the scholarly publishing crisis and specifically to the difficulties of junior faculty having monographs published by respected publishers, the monograph being still widely considered a sine qua non for attaining tenure. a complementary charge was to investigate the factual basis behind perceived concerns that types of scholarship other than single-authored monographs were not being properly recognized by those making tenure/promotion decisions and to make \u201crecommendations to address the changing environment in which scholarship is being evaluated in tenure and promotion decisions.\u201d to fulfill its charge, the task force conducted numerous interviews, read many documents and reports, and consulted with a number of committees and organizations. the major data-collection tool employed was \u201ca spring 2005 online survey of 1,339 departments in 734 institutions across the united states covering a range of doctorate, master\u2019s, and baccalaureate institutions. the response rate to the survey (51% of all departments and 67% of all institutions) provided a solid basis for the task force\u2019s analysis and recommendations.\u201d among the numerous issues addressed by the task force was the potential expansion of the definition of scholarship, and specifically the role of scholarship in electronic media. the report acknowledged that a very diverse range of digital scholarship was now pervasive in the humanities and was fundamentally changing both the production and distributio n of much scholarship. accordingly, it was necessary, according to the task force, that such new scholarly endeavor must be recognized as legitimate and that \u201cappropriate standards, practices, and modes of evaluation\u201d are applied to it. however, findings revealed that inexperience in evaluating digital scholarship is widespread: \u201ceven more troubling is the state of evaluation for digital scholarship, now an extensively used resource for scholars across the humanities: 40.8% of departments in doctorate granting institutions report no experience evaluating refereed articles in electronic format, and 65.7% report no experience evaluating monographs in electronic format.\u201d on a more positive note, the report states that a majority of departments regard digital scholarship as \u201cimportant\u201d, i.e. creditable, rather than \u201cnot important\u201d when evaluating for tenure and promotion. nevertheless, there still remain a sizable, though smaller, proportion of departments that consider it \u201cnot important\u201d in this process. the report\u2019s findings document that digital scholarship presently does not play a major role in tenure and promotion decisions. this partly reflects the numerous departments that do not yet have adequate experience with evaluating scholarship in this format. this inexperience poses a potential problem, according to the report. junior faculty members may be disinclined to risk publishing in digital formats unless they have a distinct assurance that such work will receive serious consideration in tenure/promotion processes. it\u2019s a chicken and egg question. which comes first, the faculty member\u2019s creation of the digital scholarship or the department\u2019s/institution\u2019s recognition of the value of digital scholarship and clear criteria for its evaluation for tenure and promotion? however, the report is quite explicit: nevertheless, in evaluating scholarship for tenure and promotion, committees and administrators must take responsibility for becoming fully aware both of the mechanisms of oversight and assessment that already govern the production of a great deal of digital scholarship and of the well-established role of new media in humanities research. it is of course convenient when electronic scholarly editing and writing are clearly analogous to their print counterparts. but when new media make new forms of scholarship possible, those forms can be assessed with the same rigor used to judge scholarly quality in print media. we must have the flexibility to ensure that, as new sources and instruments for knowing develop, the meaning of scholarship can expand and remain relevant to our changing times. this mla report is concerned with many more issues than that of the definition of the role of digital scholarship and the latter\u2019s place in the evaluation of tenure and promotion. it is an important document that may help bring about what many see as urgently needed changes to the production, dissemination, and evaluation of humanities scholarship. arguably the most significant part of this report are the twenty recommendations the report makes to address the \u201ccomplex situation\u201d of evaluating scholarship for tenure and promotion \u201cbefore it becomes a crisis\u201d. the report is accessible from the mla\u2019s web site [pdf]. brendan rapple collection development questions,

boston college libraries provide access to the full-color fully searchable digital american broadsides & ephemera, series i, 1760-1900 , a resource based on the collections of broadsides and ephemera held by the american antiquarian society (aas) . this database offers fully searchable facsimile images of approximately 15,000 broadsides printed between 1820 and 1900 and 15,000 pieces of ephemera printed between 1760 and 1900. the subjects covered by the broadsides and ephemera are extremely diverse and are categorized under the following headings: economics and trade; government; health; history; labor; languages; law and crime; literature; military; peoples; philosophy; politics; religion; science; society, manners and customs; theology. there are contemporary accounts of the french and indian war, the american revolution, and the civil war, facsimiles of school merit rewards, advertisements and programs for theater and music events and other popular entertainments, poems, songs, accounts of natural disasters, official government proclamations, clipper ship trading cards, notices of forthcoming slave auctions, stock certificates, trade cards, tax bills, publishers\u2019 prospectuses, dying confessions of convicted criminals, menus, reports of town meetings and a host of other hard to locate items of potentially great interest to the student of american social and cultural history. the range of material is fascinating. there are over two thousand civil war envelopes. used for actual mailing, their primary purpose was patriotic propaganda. \u201cthe decorations on these envelopes are done in every way imaginable: hand-colored, printed, engraved, embossed, etc. sometimes the illustration was small and in one corner on the front of the envelope, and other times covered both sides and included a poem or stanzas from a song.\u201d ( civil war envelopes at the american antiquarian society ). an interesting example is entitled \u201cincidents of the war, zouave pluck.\u201d this depicts a colonel named ellsworth scolding a group of zouave soldiers for being away from camp for too long. as explanation one of the zouaves declares: \u201cwait colonel until you\u2019ve seen our apology .\u201d a second zouave then \u201cpulls a secession flag from his bosom\u201d. another civil war envelope represents scenes from the 1862 battle of mill spring, kentucky, which resulted in a union victory. it is a brightly illustrated picture depicting a single soldier watching the opposing lines, a fierce battle raging around him. he is surrounded by fallen soldiers. there are several announcements of forthcoming slave auctions. one, particularly chilling, has the title: \u201cestate sale. ninety-three rice field negroes. by louis d. desaussure. on thursday, 11th january, 1855, at 11 o'clock, a.m., will be sold at auction, in charleston, at the north end of the exchange, by order of the executor of the late seaman deas, esq., and mrs. broun, a gang of ninety-three negroes, accustomed to the culture of rice and provisions on north santee.\u201d the conditions are precise: \u201cone-third cash: balance by bond payable in three equal successive annual instalments, with legal interest payable annually from day of sale, to be secured by a mortgage of the property, and approved personal security. purchasers to pay for papers.\u201d the names and age of all the slaves are listed together with brief details of illnesses, infirmities, qualifications. for example, tom, age 44, has a \u201cdefect in eye\u201d; martha, age 49, is a \u201cgood nurse, very trusty, not strong\u201d; billy, age 19, has a \u201cdisease of the hip\u201d. among the ephemera are numerous trade cards. one, dating from about 1870, is from a. w. smith, dealer in trimmings and furnishing goods, north adams, mass., for a cooley's globe corset. the blurb on the card reads: miss jones\u2019 advice miss smith has taken. and finds her friend was not mistaken. in cooley\u2019s globe corset at the ball she was the most admired of all and charlie told his love -- so she lived ever after happily. another trade card, from 1884, is entitled \u201cnoon hour on the plantation\u201d. it depicts five african american men, one playing a banjo, another dancing in the background, with the other three observing and listening intently. it\u2019s from the frick company, waynesboro, pa. and it is advertising the company\u2019s products that it will present at the world's industrial and cotton centennial exposition, new orleans the following year. the other side of the trade card mentions frick\u2019s products: \u201ctraction, plowing, farm, portable and stationary engines. vibrating threshers and \u2018waynesboro eclipse\u2019 grain separators, saw mills and cotton gins.\u201d american broadsides and ephemera contains numerous songs and ballads. \u201cthe bonnie blue flag\u201d, composed in 1861 just after the battle of manassas by henry macarthy, an irish immigrant, was a marching song set to the music of \u201cthe irish jaunting car\". it was sung throughout the confederacy and was second only to \u201cdixie\u201d in popularity. the printed song in this database is particularly interesting for the 1863 letter written in the margins by \u201ca rebel soldier to a young lady in new orleans.\u201d there is an interesting three page prospectus dated 1830 for the ursuline convent on mount benedict, charlestown, mass. \u201cthis beautiful and extensive establishment, about two and a half miles from boston . . . is now open for the admission of young ladies, from the age of six to that of fourteen. . . .\u201d there is a description of the course of studies, regulations, \"terms,\" and \"extra charges.\" it was stressed that \"the religious opinions of the children are not interfered with.\u201d the school was conducted by the ursuline sisters who moved into this new convent in charlestown in april 1828. the number of pupils increased so rapidly that two new wings were added in 1829. however, the convent and school were not popular with the local populace, largely due to the growth of evangelical protestantism and a complementary antipathy to working-class, catholic, irish immigrants and the convent was burned down in august 1834. a valuable feature of american broadsides and ephemera is that it can be cross-searched with other collections in readex\u2019s archive of americana . the archive is composed of eight databases: early american imprints, series i: evans, 1639-1800; early american imprints, series ii: shaw-shoemaker, 1801-1819 ; america's historical newspapers; american state papers, 1789-1838 ; u.s. congressional serial set, 1817-1980 ; house and senate journals, series i, 1789-1817 ; senate executive journals, series i, 1789-1866 , as well as american broadsides and ephemera . two interesting articles concerning subject matter of this database are accessible on the publisher readex\u2019s website: 1) \u201c jackasses, dogs and dead chickens: vignettes of the civil war revealed in ephemera \u201d; 2) \u201c poignant songs and poems took the civil war to the home front

graphic novels in the library there is art, there is literature, and the fusion of this is the graphic novel. these aren\u2019t your grandfather\u2019s underwear clad vigilantes. it\u2019s not batman fighting the joker to save gotham from an implausible fate once a month. admittedly, sometimes graphic novels are just that, but in recent years they have greatly extended both their literary and artistic range. nowhere is this more evident than in the recent hollywood blockbuster, the 300 , a retelling of the ancient battle of thermopylae. before it was a movie it was a comic book series by frank miller who wrote the noir thriller sin city , also made into a movie in 2005. miller\u2019s stories, gritty, dark, and vividly illustrated, rendered them naturally adaptable to the big screen. they also demonstrated that comics have indeed matured. though the comics batman, t he incredible hulk , spiderman, superman, and blade were made into movies earlier, sin city and the 300 are among the first comic book properties to become movies, at least in america, that didn\u2019t feature a spandex clad hero as the protagonist. however, there is more to comics-turned-cinema than gritty heroism and noir tales. alan moore\u2019s v for vendetta which critiqued a repressive totalitarian police state showed that graphic novels can make political statements. in fact, another work by alan moore, the twelve issue the watchmen , helped demonstrate the diversity and potential of graphic novels as an art form. the watchmen , published in 1986 and illustrated by dave gibbons, showed to many readers for the first time the potential of graphic novels as a viable medium for artistic expression. the advantage of combining graphics with literature is that an author does not necessarily have to belabor a scene with heavy description. instead it is left to the attention of the reader to discern the imagery and symbolism based on the closeness of their reading. nowhere is this subtle level of meaning and shades of symbolism clearer than in the closing pages of the watchmen. after the destruction of new york, there is a series of haunting and eerie panels of the aftermath and the toll it has taken on humanity. carefully drawn in the background are concert marquees for the bands, \u201cpale horse\u201d and \u201ckrystal nacht.\u201d reference to these bands are interspersed in the panels in the graphic novel, often appearing on posters tacked to buildings, or on flyers carried by characters. the names of the bands, \u201cpale horse,\u201d and \u201ckrystal nacht,\u201d serve as foreshadowing, the connotations and history of the terms being poignant harbingers at the conclusion of the story. while easy to overlook on a cursory reading, picking up on such subtle graphical clues can add a depth to the story not easily replicated elsewhere in solely print literature. published contemporaneously as the watchman was maus. maus is the true story of an auschwitz survivor as told by his son. while the characters are anthropomorphized as cats, mice and other creatures, it weaves a tale of the holocaust and fathers and sons . the watchmen, maus and other titles were catalysts in giving rise to a trend of comics aimed towards an audience with adult sensibilities. meeting the new demand for more complex and mature stories some larger publishers launched imprints catering to adult tastes, such as dc comic\u2019s vertigo line. while recognizing the graphic novel\u2019s new found niche exploring adult and contemporary social issues, it is still not easy to answer why the genre has become so popular. arguably, society\u2019s pervasive multi-media have rendered many of us, and especially younger people, more visually aware and perceptive. the formerly pervasive print culture is now only one of many. certainly, the graphic novel borrows heavily from the visual story telling techniques employed by movies. at the same time, the pacing is the same as a book where the reader moves as quickly or as slowly as they like. as an artistic medium the graphic novel combines the best parts of movies and reading in one innovative form. another cause for the recent surge in the popularity of graphic novels is the increase in availability of manga. manga is a term typically used for graphic novels from japan and korea. not so long ago, if one wished to procure manga, one had to head to a specialty comic store and hope for translations. now, however, a walk through any large bookstore chain will show a large and ever increasing section of titles. available waiting to be read. very popular also are the series of adaptations and retellings of ancient tales. the chinese classic, \u201cinto the west\u201d or \u201cmonkey king,\u201d was updated and retold as saiyuki as a result of this surge in popularity and burgeoning scholarship, graphic novels have found a home in boston college\u2019s curriculum. recognizing that graphic novels are more than mere comic books, boston college has begun to offer courses that feature them. the english department\u2019s \u201cnarrative and interpretation\u201d (en 133.06) examines this genre as frameworks of narration and time in literature. film studies\u2019 \u201crobots & owl-eyed heroes: japanese manga and anime,\u201d (fm 340) considers the origin, development and international appeal of anime and manga as an artform. in response to this increasing demand for graphic novels in the curriculum the library has begun to add them to its collection. from ground-breaking american works to some of the latest titles from japan, the library is providing students and scholars with the books they need. the collection will continue to grow as interest in this new literary style gains momentum. from page to film, from east to west, the graphic novel has come into its own as a genre and taken its place as literature. the only question left to answer is, \u201cwhich one do you want to read?\u201d

collections boston college libraries currently have access to over 300 online databases and more than 20,000 electronic journals. the range of online resources available on the academic market is growing very rapidly as more and more publishers move exclusively towards electronic format. moreover, in addition to primary publishers, there are numerous secondary service providers that aggregate original content and/or simply provide access via constantly improving interfaces and search engines. as a result of this evolving electronic landscape, the acquisition of electronic resources is becoming increasingly complex and the list of selection criteria and other parameters to be taken into consideration grows as well. in this quick overview we will attempt to describe how boston college libraries approach the task of acquiring new electronic materials as well as ensuring that the libraries\u2019 digital collections adequately respond to the needs of our research and teaching community. the acquisition process normally includes multiple library departments such as collection development, cataloging, acquisitions, systems, and reference & instruction. each department approaches the evaluation and acquisition of new materials from a different angle but the end goal is ultimately to make the acquisition and usage of new resources as seamless and user-friendly as possible to the bc community. what do subject specialists take into account when recommending certain electronic products for purchase or subscription? the list is long and constantly evolving but generally includes the following: content how well does it satisfy the teaching and research needs of the boston college community? do we have other products that serve similar needs and how do these products compare? content-related issues that are routinely considered are: quality of publications included in each source, e.g., are they scholarly peer-reviewed publications or are they more geared towards a popular audience? are the publications included indexed cover to cover, i.e. is every article indexed, or is indexing selective? is full text available? are there content gaps in indexing and full text? are there publisher-imposed embargoes? how far back does the product go? is a backfile available? do we retain rights to the backfile if we stop subscribing to the product? platform/interface how effective and how responsive is the search engine? how user friendly, intuitive, and easy to use is the product? how compatible and interoperable are the products under consideration with other information management tools available on the market or already at bc, e.g. linking servers, cross-search tools, interlibrary loan/document delivery services software, citation management tools, and electronic resource management software? technical support are the vendor\u2019s tech support/service personnel technically competent? are they responsive to library-raised issues? vendor\u2019s general reputation is the vendor ready to improve and to adapt to newly emerging trends and developments? is the vendor known for stable and consistent performance \u2013 both technically and business-wise? feedback from other institutions and from trade publications is this resource used by similar institutions? what do other librarians/users have to say about this resource? what is the perception of this product in professional/trade publications? cost how much does it cost? can the cost be shared/reduced via consortium deals with other university libraries? once a subject specialist decides to recommend an electronic product for consideration, he/she will arrange a trial access to the product. the systems department will then post it to the library page under electronic resource trials and it will become available to every member of the boston college community. trials typically last one month. to ensure that trials are actually utilized and do not go unnoticed, subject specialists notify their library colleagues as well as other members of the bc community, especially faculty, and request feedback. new trials are advertised on library pages, as well as through other electronic and print media. if, after appropriate testing, research, and feedback, a subject specialist considers that the database is indeed worth purchasing, he/she will submit a \u201cnew request form.\u201d since budget funds for electronic products are limited, the subject specialist must locate the funds for new subscriptions with cancellations of existing products. it is a zero-sum situation. the subject specialist is also responsible for negotiating any price and license issues. the request is initiated in the library\u2019s electronic resource management (erm) system, a locally created system designed to manage the review, acquisition, licensing, invoicing, and evaluation process for the many electronic products. the request for the new title is submitted to the electronic resources review board \u2013 a group that includes representatives from several library departments. this group reviews each request and either approves or declines it based on how it fits the library\u2019s financial and strategic situation. the group also relies heavily on the recommendation of the subject specialist. if approved, multiple library departments become involved. we then convert the trial to permanent access, process a payment, add the new product to local library services, such as the quest catalog, the online databases page, crosssearch, a tool that allows simultaneous searching of multiple databases, and findit, bc library\u2019s linking server that allows linking from citations to full text and other relevant services such as ill, refworks, etc. librarians monitor very closely how library products are being used and if negotiated access rights satisfy our library requirements. an important strategy utilized is the gathering of monthly statistics that are analyzed at the end of each subscription year. usage reports constitute a significant criterion regarding the decision to extend or terminate subscription to electronic products. ultimately librarians want to buy and renew products that are useful to library patrons, so patrons\u2019 usage of, in addition to feedback about, the resource are key in shaping our electronic collections and making them adequate to the needs of our library community. nina bogdanovsky digital resources reference librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries

initiatives, as part of an ongoing effort to ensure long-term access to scholarly journals delivered in digital formats rather than in print. the first initiative, portico , is a hosted service launched in 2005 with significant backing from the andrew w. mellon foundation , ithaka , the library of congress , and jstor . publishers that have agreed to provide content to portico for archiving include the american mathematical society, annual reviews, elsevier, oxford university press, sage publications, and the university of chicago press, among others. the second archiving initiative is lots of copies keep stuff safe (lockss) , a distributed network of archive appliances running open-source software developed by stanford university, with backing from the mellon foundation and the national science foundation . publishers participating in the lockss program include the american historical association, bioone, the insitute of physics, johns hopkins press, and indiana university press, among others. the lockss program was launched in 2004, and has been adopted at approximately 160 colleges and universities around the world. the two archiving programs are at this point complementary, covering mostly different publisher and title lists, and employing very different technological approaches to establish digital archives of e-journal content. the libraries will be working over the next several months to inventory e-journal content that is eligible to be included in either portico or lockss, and to ensure that the eligible content is included and activated in the archives. further information about this archiving effort will be included in the fall newsletter. bob gerrity library systems, head questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review

article in mid-april each year library journal journals in the time of google \u201d (15 april), reveals, just as in previous years, that the average annual increase per journal title in most subject areas is greater, sometimes much greater, than the rate of inflation. in short, the article corroborates what the majority of librarians are already well aware of, namely that the ever-mounting annual increases in the cost of journals are playing havoc with acquisition budgets and are making it increasingly difficult for libraries to build balanced collections that meet the research and pedagogical needs of faculty and students. not surprisingly, journals in scientific and technological disciplines have the highest costs, with chemistry being in the forefront with $3,254 as the average cost per title. physics, engineering, astronomy, and technology are next in terms of cost. however, while scientific and technological journals tend to cost the most in absolute terms, the actual rate of price increase over the past five years is often higher for journals in other subject areas. for example, journals in political science, education, and history have, on average, been subject to higher price increases in recent years than journals in most other areas. it is perhaps ironic, at least to librarians, that the average cost of library & information science journals has increased 53% since 2002, a rate of change higher than for most scientific and technological journals. the average cost of us journals is far from being the highest. based on the international group of journals comprising the three institute for scientific information (isi) databases\u2014arts and humanities citation index, social sciences citation index, and science citation index \u2013 the average price of journals emanating from russia, the netherlands, and ireland is the highest at over $2,500 per title. us journals, admittedly far greater in number, have an average cost of $713. \u201cjournals in the time of google\u201d, is particularly interesting not only for its statistical breakdown of journal prices but also for its commentary on swiftly evolving trends in the dissemination of scholarship in both journal and monograph format. the authors, lee c. van orsdel and kathleen born, briefly discuss the swiftly growing open access (oa) movement and the reactions of scholars and publishers. the directory of open access journals (doaj) , numbering over 2,200 peer reviewed oa journals has grown by more than 600 over the past year. the journal plos biology , only in its second year of publication, is already the world\u2019s highest ranked general biology journal based on its impact factor of 13.9. the authors also point out that \u201cfive oa journals from biomed central ranked in the top five journals in their specialties.\u201d moreover, the authors report that oa articles garner between 25% and 250% more citations than non-oa articles in the same journal. another topic briefly considered in \u201cjournals in the time of google\u201d is the bundling by commercial publishers of scholarly journals, a practice strongly disliked by librarians who \u201clament the lack of choice, loss of fluidity in materials expenditures, and nondisclosure agreements that prevent libraries and consortia from comparing purchase prices.\u201d other topics briefly considered in the article include: the proposed policy to mandate that peer reviewed journal articles that result from national institutes of health (nih) funded research be archived in the openly accessible database pubmed central ; the growing need to archive digital content through such initiatives as portico and lockss ; the attitudes of both publishers and authors to the posting of pre- and postprints of journal articles on the author\u2019s personal web page or in an institutional repository. to read the full-text of the article click \u201c journals in the time of google \u201d. brendan rapple

the survey is designed to measure library users' perceptions of service quality and identify gaps between minimum, perceived, and desired expectations of service. the survey addresses three major areas of library service: affect of service, information control, and library as place. 3300 members of the university community were randomly selected to participate in libqual+. of that number, 113 undergraduates, 151 graduate students, 147 faculty, and 56 staff members completed the survey. 161 respondents (34%) included additional comments. an initial review of the answers and comments reveals the following: seamless access to online databases and e-journals is of utmost importance to our users improved access to online resources should not come at the expense of print collections interlibrary loan is an essential service utilized and appreciated by faculty, students, and staff library users require an inviting and comfortable library that has both group study space and quiet

a proposal for a book project that was ambitious and yet very personal. the book, the timing of the book, and the role of the o\u2019neill library all evoked an interesting confluence of events and experiences during the past few years, creating some insightful observations about scholarship in the 21st century. in this brief article, i will present some musings about writing a scholarly book that has sought to move readers emotionally as well as intellectually. this story will also touch on the changing role of the o\u2019neill library, which is evolving and transforming as we move into the 21st century. comments from david blustein brief interview (2:47 min) full interview (13:06 min) real player required for viewing. from the new faculty publication highlights series available at: bc.edu/facpub. sending out my book proposal on september 10, 2001 left me with some time to reflect on the mammoth project that i was undertaking. the next day, i awoke to a beautiful day as i started the second sabbatical of my academic year. as the morning broke, news of the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon soon filled the day and the coming weeks and months. at that point, it seemed hard to put all of my heart and soul into a project that, while relevant and timely, seemed to pale in comparison to the pain caused by 9/11. however, the advent of 9/11 also shifted how i viewed my writing project and how i viewed access to the resources that i would need to make this book come alive. the role of 9/11 played a subtle, yet pronounced role in the preparation and execution of my book. for me, 9/11 underscored the reality that life was precious and short; moreover, it affirmed the critical role that inequity plays in creating a world of haves and have-nots. while there are many complex ways to construct the 9/11 narrative, one means of understanding this horrific event is that the rage of the have-nots became intolerable and was no longer confined within the boundaries of a nation or a culture. although i would not suggest that access to work is a panacea for the ills of our world, i do believe that work plays a major role in providing structure for people\u2019s lives and in sustaining the hope and connection that help to create meaning in our lives. the book that i have written, entitled the psychology of working: a new perspective on career development, counseling, and public policy (published by lawrence erlbaum associates) has sought to transform the field of career development. the area of career development has focused for the most part on helping people to make wise choices about their educational and vocational options. while this field has blossomed in the 20th century, yielding informative theories and useful tools (such as interest inventories and other forms of self and career exploration), something important was missing. in short, the field of career development became a discipline that essentially favored the privileged who had access to volitional careers. people without much, if any access, to the resources that are associated with successful educational and career experiences, have been left to fend for themselves. another limitation in existing scholarship, which my work has sought to redress, is the marginalization of discussions about work within psychology and counseling. clients in psychotherapy who present work-related problems were often informed that their issues were manifestations of unresolved family issues, thereby invalidating their concerns. the psychology of working perspective that i have advanced has sought to place working at the center of psychological discourse, with implications for counseling practice, public policy, and research. in order to achieve these lofty goals in the post 9/11 world, i needed a way to speak to readers so that they would experience as well as reflect on the issues that i raised. my intention with this book project was to transform the nature of academic scholarship in my field. rather than relying exclusively on empirical research and scholarly theories, i wanted to give readers an experience-near connection to the full scope of working. using the narrative approach, which is gaining increasing popularity in the social and behavioral sciences, i integrated traditional academic scholarship with the use of song lyrics, poems, memoirs, and excerpts from plays and novels to give voice to the diverse array of working experiences. the task that i assumed was daunting. i needed to familiarize myself with bodies of literature that were well outside of the scope of my training and experience. moreover, i was faced with the need to collect large volumes of literature and store them in my office or home, both of which are currently limited in space. here is where boston college\u2019s electronic library that has emerged in recent years became invaluable. first, i was able to gain access to an incredible number of journals via the on-line library, which helped considerably in locating resources for my book project. second, the staff of the o\u2019neill library briefed me in accessing literature outside of my field. this later point is particularly helpful in the era of increasingly specialized scholars who rarely venture outside of their fields. without the input of the library staff, i would have struggled to make sense of the vast array of options that exists in our library. in closing, the recent publication of my book has been a wonderful experience that reflects the contributions of so many people in my life. often the libraries that provide the resources for our scholarly efforts remain in the background, without any overt acknowledgement. i hope that my brief vignette about this book gives credit to the library and to its excellent staff who often stay behind the scenes without the acknowledgements that they well deserve. david blustein director of doctoral training, department of counseling,

libraries newsletter volume 7 number 3 summer 2006 subject area highlight: interdisciplinary resources one of the changes in library reference service brought on by google and the ubiquitous web is the decline in the traditional ready reference or factual question at the reference desk. the easy access to online dictionaries, encyclopedias, personal pages, blogs, and other sources of information (some more reliable than others) results in students pursuing these questions on their own. perhaps the most heavily used of these sources is wikipedia. the press and buzz on wikipedia is plentiful as to its quality (both pro and con) and it is safe to say that it will be difficult to wean students from it and google. naturally, libraries and publishers are not isolated from this trend. myriad sources and services that typically respond to factual and introductory questions are increasingly available online. these online sources are more current, more interdisciplinary, and provide access to more information with external links. further, libraries offer e-mail reference and, more relevant, 24/7 reference chat service. the libraries offer students these reliable resources and other service options so students can double-check information (in itself a good research habit). systemically, the libraries need to work on improving access to the resources available, with the goal that students will think of these resources first when engaged in research. here are some of these more respected resources available from the boston college libraries: american national biography and the oxford dictionary of national biography : both of these titles were prestigious print publications and both have transitioned to the web in elegant fashion. their goals are the same, biographies of notable deceased individuals from the united states and the united kingdom. the new online editions are more inclusive, offer special features, more powerful and flexible searching and content enhanced with multimedia. both are updated regularly. biography resource center : if you need a biography of jackie chan, as opposed to george orwell, this is a good place to search. while it also offers biographies of historical figures, you can read up on more contemporary people. in fact, it has more than 400,000 biographies from around the world. encyclopedia britannica : the online edition of the venerable work includes the complete encyclopedia, as well as merriam-webster's collegiate dictionary and the britannica book of the year. you can also search an internet directory that includes more than 130,000 links to web sites selected, rated, and reviewed by britannica editors. you can search it, browse it, use the atlas and timeline, get some country data, find a quotation, and read some classic texts. special features include \u201cthis day in history,\" \"biography of the day,\" and links to headline news. facts.com : facts.com brings together complete content from the facts on file world news digest since 1940 and selected content from six other core reference databases to answer questions about events, issues, statistics and people for that time period. gale's ready reference : provides access to entries from 14 reference directories including: directories in print, directory of special libraries and information centers, encyclopedia of american religions, encyclopedia of associations, encyclopedia of governmental advisory organizations, gale directory of databases, gale directory of publications and broadcast media, newsletters in print, publishers directory, research centers directory, international research centers directory, government research centers directory. it contains more than 355, 000 listings for associations, research centers, publishers, publications (ranging from newspapers and newsletters to periodicals and directories), databases, television and radio stations, and more. it is fully searchable across all files. oxford english dictionary : the editors say it best, the oed \"is the accepted authority on the evolution of the english language over the last millennium. it is an unsurpassed guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of over half a million words, both present and past. it traces the usage of words through 2.5 million quotations from a wide range of international english language sources, from classic literature and specialist periodicals to film scripts and cookery books.\" it is regularly updated with hundreds of entries each year. oxford reference online : this is a collection of more than 100 reference titles covering more than twenty broad subject areas. search all 1.5 million dictionary definition, facts, figures, people, places, dates, and quotations simultaneously or select a

communication at bc: creating an online bibliography scholars engaged in library research often rely on indexes, journals, and books as well as a more specialized resource type, the subject bibliography. subject bibliographies can be as short as a page and as long as a multivolume set, and until recently they have been produced primarily in print format. typically, they are the product of an individual scholar or a team of scholars who, after determining the subject\u2019s scope, gathered and organized the data into a useful intellectual framework for publication. but because of the web, scholars can now consider another publishing option, one that offers a more dynamic way of creating and using subject bibliographies. last year while on a research leave, i created a bibliography in buddhist-christian scholarship, a subject area familiar to me through my own research and writing. the buddhist-christian studies database or bcsd is available on the web and searchable in ways similar to commercial indexes like the mla international bibliography or sociological abstracts. i used reference manager , a software tool like endnote or refworks which is used to gather citations and manage bibliographies. in addition to standard citation manager features, reference manager can be used to publish bibliographies on the web in an online searchable format. researchers can search bcsd for authors, titles, and keywords and limit by publication year, document type (e.g., article, essay, dissertation), and language. it also permits the selection of specific citations and exporting them to another citation manager like endnote or refworks. bcsd\u2019s subject scope was in large part determined by the annual journal buddhist-christian studies , considered by many to be one of the more important records of scholarly discussions about the encounter between the two religious traditions. i browsed the journal\u2019s articles and book reviews in order to identify the initial keywords for bcsd\u2019s keyword list , a feature of the database which provides links between articles about the same topics. currently, the years covered by bcsd are 1995 to the present, but i will continue adding citations to articles appearing in buddhist-christian studies and other journals as well as citations to essays, books, and dissertations until bcsd\u2019s coverage extends back to 1981, buddhist-christian studies\u2019 first year of publication. the citations for bcsd are being gathered from conventional sources like atla religion database , philosopher\u2019s index , and dissertations and theses \u2013 full text , but also by submissions from scholars working in this subject area. messages about bcsd and its openness to submitted citations have been posted on scholarly listservs, and i have made presentations about bcsd to scholarly organizations like the society for buddhist-christian studies . submitted citations can be to published articles, essays, and books, but also to unpublished conference papers available on stable web servers or in a university\u2019s institutional repository like boston college\u2019s escholarship@bc . some journal publishers permit published articles to be placed in institutional repositories; if that is the case, bcsd can link to these articles as well. from the beginning, my purpose has been to create an open access database, i.e., a free web resource. as such, it is a contribution to scholarly communication and the growing open access movement ably described by peter suber on his website . bcsd provides researchers with a tool which identifies material relevant to their research and provides links to full text items freely available on the web. it also enables scholars to publicize their work by allowing them to submit citations, and once the citation appears in bcsd, it is immediately connected by keyword links to all the other items in bcsd on the same topic. if bcsd is to succeed in the

changes over the past academic year the library web assessment group (wag) solicited feedback regarding users' experience finding information using the libraries' website. based on a library staff survey and two focus groups with bc graduate and undergraduate students, wag has identified the following themes and key points to address: organize the site to be task-oriented. for example, links might be worded as: \u201cfind books\u201d or \u201cfind journal articles.\u201d highlight the most heavily used resources and make them more accessible and visible. use language that is more user-friendly and less based on library jargon. consolidate the links that lead students to help (ask a librarian, contact us, subject specialists), and present them at points of need. increase the size of the text and make the site more engaging with the use of graphics. before the fall 2006 semester, the office of marketing communications will introduce a new look to many boston college websites, including the bc libraries. the libraries hope to take advantage of this transition to implement changes in response to these findings. o'neill library use survey in may, 2006 the

been three years since the first meeting of the group. once or twice a semester, they gather in the connors center. members choose the books and take turns leading discussions. as faculty and staff

of the books as well as lunch for the meetings. burt howell, director of the intersections project, is one of the regular members: \u201cthe intersections reading group gives me an excuse to discover

digitization initiative the project in december, 2004 google announced a major new initiative as google\u2019s press release stated, \u201cusers searching with google will see links in their search results page when there are books relevant to their query. clicking on a title delivers a google print page where users can browse the full text of public domain works and brief excerpts and/or bibliographic data of copyrighted material. library content will be displayed in keeping with copyright law.\u201d the new project is an expansion of the google print program, which assists publishers in making their books searchable online. presently google locates the books found by a google print search at the top of the page indicated by an icon of books to the left. under its new initiative, google does not plan to have a separate search engine specifically devoted to searching the scanned monographs. this has resulted in the criticism that the digitized books, though numbering in millions, may be swamped by the hundreds of millions of other web pages searched during a google search. other full-text digitization projects google\u2019s initiative is, of course, not the first book digitization project engaged in by libraries and others. large monographic digitization programs include michigan\u2019s own digital library text collection , oxford\u2019s text archive , the alex catalogue of electronic texts , the electronic text center at the university of virginia , project bartleby archive , project gutenberg , berkeley\u2019s literature@sunsite , the internet archive million book project . will such projects, small in scale when contrasted with google\u2019s undertaking, survive? it is not yet clear. while most of the books digitized in these projects are freely available, there are other large sophisticated digitization projects that may be purchased, for example early english books online (eebo) , eighteenth century collections online , evans digital edition/early american imprints all of which are owned by bc libraries. will libraries continue to expend often considerable funds on full-text collections like these? i think that the answer is yes, at least for the next several years. first of all, they currently exist and scholars need them now. they are also discrete uniform collections that allow complex searching. it is unlikely that google will permit users to select such a distinct body of works that make up, say, evans early american imprints , out of all its millions of digitized materials and facilitate advanced searching of this sub-group. nevertheless, i believe that google is raising the bar for future digitization projects. the latter\u2019s survival will surely depend on what value, for example scholarly essays, biographical materials, annotations, sound, video etc., they add to mere digitized text to create more attractive packages. reactions to google\u2019s initiative many are criticizing google\u2019s new initiative. one influential library author argues that it will be disastrous for google users to have access to the full-text of only pre-1923 monographs, that is works in the public domain, the implication being that users will confine their searches to this material and fail to seek out later works. this seems particularly ironic as for years librarians and others have been critical of students\u2019 tendency to limit their reading to electronic material much of which is of recent vintage. michael gorman, dean of library services at cal state, fresno and president-elect of the american library association, is also quite critical of the google initiative. as he argued in an op-ed piece in the los angeles times many librarians and faculty have for years been critical of the increasingly pervasive google culture and the great range of quality of web content to which google\u2019s search engine points. some contend that though the internet makes readily available so much information, far too many students are still ignorant of enormous amounts of knowledge not available on the web and indeed are unwilling to seek such material. however, the inclusion of millions of books in this new digitization project should result in google searches retrieving more quality hits. a potentially wonderful benefit of this new undertaking is that it will alert huge numbers throughout the globe to the existence, as well as the full-text content, of many of the world\u2019s books. some might say that the goal of google is grandiose, i.e. \u201cto organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. since a lot of the world's information isn't yet online, we're helping to get it there. google print puts the content of books where you can find it most easily \u2013 right in google search results.\u201d nevertheless, to the extent that google makes some, indeed a great deal, of this latter knowledge accessible on the web, it is indisputably a great boon. it may not be hyperbolic to predict that google\u2019s initiative will create the world\u2019s first great virtual library. conclusion though a wonderful virtual library is nigh, let me underscore my conviction that this new google initiative will not herald the imminent demise of the research library as we know it. rather, i believe that it will assist the latter in developing into the hub of a pervasive electronic community where diverse information technologies will become ever more integral to the university's mission of teaching, research and learning. the library is evolving and assuming new roles; it is far from becoming obsolete. nor do i believe that librarians are emulating the irish elk by becoming extinct! initiatives like that of google and others that are introducing such positive changes to the range and availability of the informational world, while at the same time rendering information assessment so challenging, will ensure that librarians continue to play their established role in providing library instruction and in helping students critically evaluate the worth of information that is now so accessible. brendan rapple

a new foundation for research electronic journals have emerged as a major source of information for the boston college community in recent years, in many cases eclipsing the long-established tradition of print journal usage in certain disciplines. faculty and students have come to rely on e-journal features that print journals could never offer. users can access journals from outside the library and off-campus, more than one user can access the same journal issue, users can be alerted via e-mail when articles relevant to their research are published, articles can link to video and audio clips, and e- journals can be searched full text. moreover, checking footnotes and references is more easily accomplished because article citations can link to the full text articles being cited. similarly, major journal indexes which are in electronic format can now have their citations linked directly to indexed articles. given the many advantages of e-journals over their print counterparts, it is no surprise that e-journals enjoy a rising popularity on campus. indeed, students and faculty have been requesting access to more e-journals and e-journal backfiles. for the library, this emergence of e-journals as a highly valued and popular research resource offers an added advantage: a solution to the problem of space shortage. for the past ten years, the library has transferred approximately 30,000 volumes every year to its off-site collection facilities in order to free shelf space for new books and bound journals. because journal collections represent not only current information but a cumulative body of recorded knowledge, it has always been the responsibility of research libraries to preserve scholarly journal back issues. the durability of bound journals in the print format is a proven fact librarians and researchers have come to rely on. can the same be said of electronic journals? will e-journals published in 2005 be available in future decades or centuries the same way print journals from the 19th and 20th centuries still fill library shelves? much evidence argues against a positive view about e-journal archives. our common experience of the web\u2019s volatility can undermine any certainty about being able to return to web pages found last month or even yesterday. the durability of e-journals is an extremely important question for researchers and librarians. if e-journals are deemed to be impermanent resources, libraries will need to continue building print journal collections to serve as reliable back issue archives. libraries would then be collecting duplicate content, albeit in different formats, and spending valuable funds and staff hours to do so. however, academic libraries are making decisions to cancel print subscriptions when electronic journals are available, thereby realizing savings in funds, staff time, and space. according to one survey , the majority of libraries surveyed expect to replace print with electronic journals within the next ten years. what are some of the reasons and facts used to support these decisions which some may think are risky and premature? first of all, it is important to be clear about the type of e-journal being considered as a reliable resource. access to full text e-journals in index databases (also known as \u201cthird party\u201d aggregators) like expanded academic or business source premier is not guaranteed. such e-journals can be removed from the index at any time; there is no contractural obligation on the part of the index database vendor to maintain access to any given e-journal title. research libraries prefer to rely on a second type of e-journal, the kind offered directly by publishers like elsevier and oxford university press and distinguished from the first type primarily by the existence of signed licenses between libraries and publishers. such licenses include language about the continued availability of purchased content (i.e., back issues) even if subscriptions are canceled. such licenses are an important first step in creating a legacy e-journal collection, but it is only the first step. the creation of publisher journal archives for library users runs counter to traditional library practice. if nothing else were done, librarians and researchers would be relying on publishers rather than on libraries to preserve the knowledge contained in e-journals. many argue that confidence in such an arrangement is a false confidence because commercial publishers cannot be held to the same principles guiding research libraries. contractural guarantees may offer a solution, but it is only a short-term solution. the library world should be working toward a long-term solution of its own, and happily it is. a number of initiatives have been undertaken and are still underway to investigate the technology needed to create stable e-journal archives and the economic models required to sustain them. organizations like the digital library foundation , the council on library and information resources , and the coalition for networked information began facilitating practical experiments in archiving. examples include stanford university\u2019s lockss project (\u201clots of copies keeps stuff safe\u201d) and the jstor electronic-archiving initiative which is now being further developed as e-archive, an entity within a larger project called ithaka . a number of reports are available on the web describing in detail the efforts and results of such initiatives. the foundation for an archival infrastructure for e-journals based on traditional library values is being laid. given the positive support given by users at boston college for increased e-journal access and the need to address space and budgetary challenges, the boston college libraries are proceeding with a journal duplication review. it will involve librarians and faculty members reviewing print counterparts of e-journal titles that are currently accessible by licensed agreement with publishers. the goal is to eliminate duplication as much as possible by canceling the print versions. in a report published in d-lib magazine titled \u201clibrary periodicals expenses comparison of non-subscription costs of print and electronic formats on a life-cycle basis,\u201d the authors conclude: the transition to the electronic format seems likely to afford reductions in libraries' long-term financial commitments to non-subscription costs. this is good news for the many libraries that are well along into this transition and would find it difficult to step back. this finding may also be useful to the libraries that have been more reluctant to move towards this new format. each year, a library that has transitioned to the electronic format for periodicals may have the opportunity to avoid immediate costs and long-term financial commitments on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars. the long-term benefits of the journal duplication review and resulting print cancellations will free up money currently spent on processing, binding, and shelving journals, i.e., non-subscription costs. this means that there will be more funds and free space for acquiring and shelving unique information appearing in monographs and other formats. in starting the review, bc faculty and librarians will have taken a significant step toward laying a new kind of foundation for future research at boston college. note: more information about the journal duplication review may be found on the library\u2019s research collections pages. jonas barciauskas head of collection development questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe to the faculty

number 2 spring 2005 faculty perspective: medieval (re)collections fifteen years ago, as part of an on-campus visit whose aim was to encourage me to accept a position in the department of romance languages & literatures , a soon-to-be colleague suggested that a visit to o\u2019neill library might tip the balance in favor of boston college. anticipating a tour of its enviable holdings in spanish literature and theology, and eager to savor the antiquarian delicacies of burns library , i was therefore perplexed as to why my hispanic virgil decided instead to forego these treasure troves in favor of a descent to the first circle of o\u2019neill library, where a lone service desk attendant bathed in fluorescent light contrasted sharply with the shadowy figures in an adjacent barely illuminated room. we had arrived, my guide proudly announced, to the microfilm room. although hardly the holy grail of medievalists such as myself, the microfilm room\u2014more properly, if not enticingly, known as government documents and microforms \u2014contains an astounding array of materials on every conceivable subject. since joining the ranks of those shades i encountered on that first visit, i have availed myself on numerous occasions of the microfilm and microfiche readers to examine the library\u2019s superb collection of hispanic literature, inquisitorial documents, and hebrew liturgical texts. in addition, the library houses tens of thousands of pages, in microfiche format, of medieval and renaissance spanish, portuguese, and catalan works published by the hispanic seminary of medieval studies. and there are, of course, those hundreds of thousands of american government documents, whose value i can appreciate\u2014vicariously. and for those of us whose technological skills are truly medieval, the well-informed and courteous staff is always available to assist. on one memorable occasion, i was frustrated in my efforts to decipher the microfilm images of a parisian manuscript so severely water-damaged that script and splotch were indistinguishable. doubtless concerned that my expletives would drive away other patrons, a documents assistant appeared and quickly ushered me into a large space reminiscent in its starkness and glaring white light of a hospital operating room. seated at an oversize microfilm reader, the specialist examined the blurry film, and then, with practiced expertise, began to excise the offending stains that had obscured my manuscript for over three centuries. i do not pretend to understand this technological wizardry, but i am grateful that i can now perceive my text through a glass clearly. an unexpected pleasure of working in this environment is the opportunity to meet other literary archeologists. i recall, for example, my chance encounter in 2001 with patricia donlon, the distinguished former director of the national library of ireland. although she was spending her tenure as a burns scholar that year working on children\u2019s literature, she revealed to me that in an earlier incarnation she had completed a phd on the polyphemus myth in spanish golden age poetry at university college, dublin, proving that even those condemned to the first circle can enjoy serendipity. dwayne carpenter professor of hispanic studies romance languages & literatures dept. questions, comments? contact the bc

political science political science is an inclusive discipline, incorporating a wide range of methods and approaches. among the field's diverse areas of study are political theory; the workings of government in the united states and abroad; american foreign policy; and international organizations, security, and political economy. the boston college libraries offer digital resources to appeal to political scientists of all stripes. in addition to databases that deal directly with politics and government, the libraries provide resources of interest relating to history, economics, philosophy, and current news. here are highlights of a few of these resources: columbia international affairs online (ciao) ciao bills itself \"the most comprehensive source for theory and research in international affairs,\" and it does a fine job fulfilling this. fifteen years' worth of scholarship is gathered on this site, including not only journal articles and abstracts and full-length books, but also hard-to-find material such as research institute working papers, ngos' series of occasional papers, foundation-funded research projects, conference proceedings, and policy briefs. in addition to research material, ciao offers country and regional maps and data, as well as teaching material, including case studies, course packs, and syllabi. tip: sign up for the email newsletter, offering notification of monthly content updates. cq electronic library (cqel) the boston college libraries now offer access to three components of the cq electronic library: cq weekly , cq researcher , and cq encyclopedia of american government . the online version of cq weekly presents the periodical's well-known exhaustive coverage of congress in an interface that allows for searching of articles and floor votes by keyword, date, bill number, or topic. published since 1923, the award-winning cq researcher presents in-depth overviews 44 times a year on vital political and social issues. the online version includes an archive from 1991 to the present. the cq encyclopedia of american government offers over 2000 articles on the presidency, congress, supreme court, and elections, supplemented by data, images, primary source documents, and other enhancements. tip: in cqel, you can search across all three databases at once; check \"document history\" to see documents previously viewed from all three databases; or save \"favorite documents\" from all three databases for later viewing. past masters view published and unpublished works and correspondence of major figures in political philosophy with the past masters database. it includes works by augustine, bentham, hegel, hobbes, and marx and engels, in addition to works and selected correspondence by locke and sidgwick. the collections british philosophy 1600-1900 and political philosophy: machiavelli to mill offer works of dozens more philosophers, including francis bacon, david hume, thomas paine, jean-jacques

google scholar - what's the buzz? google scholar (gs) is an exciting new development by google.com; its goal is to \u201chelp users search scholarly literature such as peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, preprints, abstracts and technical reports.\u201d the o\u2019neill reference staff recently took a look at google scholar and tested it against some of our subscription databases. below is a summary of our discoveries and some recommendations. what's being searched the emphasis of gs is on providing access to \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d literature, so content is primarily journal articles and books. preprint servers are also searched, sometimes resulting in retrieval of multiple versions of a document. other \u201cresearch material\u201d that you might expect to find does not appear, presumably because it is not peer-reviewed (e.g. annual reports, patents). occasionally the results of your search might include non-scholarly (or less scholarly) materials such as poster sessions, symposium presentation schedules, and pamphlets. publishers have the option of whether to participate in google scholar or not by allowing gs\u2019s web-crawler to search their web site and permit abstracts to be displayed for their journals. sometimes you will find a major publisher represented only because its journals are being cited in other publishers' pages; their journals are not indexed in gs (e.g. the american chemical society journals). unlike the subscription databases where you can get detailed information about the contents of the database, gs does not provide a list of participating publishers. searching gs google scholar has an advanced search option that permits you to limit your search by author, publication or date, but traditional databases usually provide many more options to refine your search according to the needs of the discipline. google scholar searches in the same way that regular google does; it will retrieve all results that featured your keyword regardless of context. for example, a search for \u201cbeowulf\u201d, the 10th century anglo-saxon poem, returns many results on beowulf computer clusters. to get better results try adding search terms or click on the definition of the term in the upper right section of the web page for additional help. results sometimes you will get seamless access to the full text in gs because of a subscription paid by the boston college libraries; other times you may not be able to access articles we own except by going through the libraries\u2019 gateway. if you can not view the full text through gs, check the boston college libraries\u2019 online catalog, quest , to see if the library has an electronic or print copy. if an article is not available in the library, use interlibrary loan to request a free copy. the library is investigating the use of the firefox browser and a firefox extension for google scholar. this will result in the find it option displaying and providing links to resources available via the boston college libraries. a few examples of discipline-specific search results psychology chemistry physics \u2013 \u201cnanotechnology\u201d searching provided very strong results, owing to the wide participation of the major physics publishers in google scholar. business \u2013 gs contained many citations to scholarly business topics. materials such as financial ratios, market share and annual reports are not in google scholar; although they are available in regular google.com. classics \u2013 searching for \u201chomer and ilium \u201d produced some very good sources. it also located several \u201carticles\u201d which seem to be college papers. when to use gs in general we would suggest starting your research in one of the libraries\u2019 databases because you can select a subject database specific to your topic and you can refine your search better. we would recommend using google scholar as a supplement to the libraries' resources. if you need help with your research please contact a reference librarian . there are many materials available in gs that the library does not own. please remember that if you find citations in gs and need to obtain the full text, the library staff can help you. please feel free to contact us . for more information, please consult: google scholar focuses on research-quality content by barbara quint (information

2006 burns scholar perspective one of the great joys of being the burns library visiting scholar at boston college is having access to both the burns and o\u2019neill libraries. warwick university, in england where i work, is not a good research library for someone like me whose research interests lie generally in the area of irish women\u2019s history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. i either have to travel to dublin to do my research or go to the nearest well-stocked library, the bodleian in oxford. though i must admit it is never a chore to do either of these things, there is something wonderful about having two excellent libraries within walking distance of my residence. currently i am working on a collaborative project with dr. gerardine meaney of university college, dublin. we are, with the able research assistance of three post-doctoral fellows and funding from the arts and humanities research council, constructing a bibliographic database of all irish women writers who wrote, in the irish and/or english languages, between 1800 and 2000. both the burns and o\u2019neill libraries have offered treasures for this database. it is not easy to locate many of the volumes and writers we are listing but a surprising number are held here. few will have heard of lily mcmanus, a staunch supporter of the language revival movement. her autobiography, white light and flame: memories of the irish literary revival and anglo-irish war (1929), manages to ignore about half her life. that life, for her, really starts when she is 41, and begins to read irish history. when we all take for granted access to libraries, and knowledge, mcmanus\u2019s attempt to get a reader\u2019s ticket for the library at trinity college dublin, shows how far we have progressed. she noted: \u2018one of the fellows of trinity college gave me a card of introduction \u2026 all this was to enable me to get a reader\u2019s ticket \u2026 in an ante room to the library \u2026 an old man with a skull cap in a shrill angry voice called out \u201ci won\u2019t give you anything! it\u2019s no use you coming.\u201d i told him i had not come for a subscription, but for a reader\u2019s ticket \u2026 he replied unpleasantly that he did not want women to get tickets. i offered him my card of introduction. he took it sullenly and grudgingly gave me a ticket\u2019. two of her novels, the silke of the kine (1896:1902) and the professor in ireland (1918) are also available in the o\u2019neill library and burns library respectively. the professor in ireland was serialised in the newspaper sinn fein, held in both hard copy and on microfilm in the burns and o\u2019neill libraries respectively. a close friend of mcmanus was another language revivalist, mary e. l. butler, credited with naming griffith\u2019s political organisation, sinn fein . a number of her pamphlets for the gaelic league are available in the burns library. amongst the hundreds of books by irish women writers held in the o\u2019neill there are works by pamela hinkson, the daughter of the prolific author katharine tynan. hinkson was a novelist, travel writer and biographer. six of dorothea conyers novels can also be located in the o\u2019neill. she was a writer of \u2018light romantic\u2019 fiction, keen on horses and ponies. annie m. p. smithson is also well represented in the collections. smithson noted in her autobiography that at her birth her mother remarked, \u201coh, take her away. the ugly little thing\u201d. unsurprisingly, she was estranged from her mother for much of her life. but it is not only the novels and memoirs and autobiographies that are of interest, both libraries also hold substantial collections of journals and newspapers which offered women in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries space for their writing. the burns has hard copies of the united irishman where many irish women, including alice milligan, found an outlet for their nationalist views. similarly, donohue\u2019s magazine , which is available in the burns from 1879 to 1907, is a treasure trove of writing by irishwomen. the o\u2019neill collection of irish newspapers on microfilm also offers much to the researcher in this area. the irish press , for instance, was noted from the 1970s for its publication of new irish writing. likewise both the national and local press, from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, offered opportunities for writers to publish short stories and to serialise novels. this short piece barely does justice to the holdings of these libraries. both libraries contain serious and substantial collections of irish women\u2019s writing. dr. maria luddy burns library visiting scholar questions, comments? contact the bc

libraries newsletter volume 7 number 2 spring 2006 bringing the library into the e-learning environment course webct sites are proving to be prime locations for access to course-specific online library resources. by presenting links in webct course sites to well-chosen, high-quality online books, journal articles, databases, tutorials, research guides and other scholarly materials, faculty can encourage students to use resources that will enable them to improve their research skills and locate higher quality sources for their papers and research projects. digitized books, films, audio files, and images can also be added to webct sites to provide direct access to primary source materials. a first step is as simple as providing a direct link to the online course reserves. faculty who provide their syllabi or reading lists to the bc libraries course reserves staff can request that a link be added to the course site. students can then click directly from the site to their required journal articles and single chapter readings in full text. students can also locate these readings in the course reserves catalog in quest, but a link in webct allows students to view the syllabus, course materials and the reserve readings from the same location. contact the reserves staff at oneill.reserves@bc.edu to set up online course reserves or to add this link to your courses. students in the history of german literature class taught by prof. rachel freudenberg have been pleased with the availability in their webct site of direct links to the bc libraries\u2019 full-text online editions of works by brecht and goethe. students can print out the assigned chapters and make notes, comments, and translations directly on their printouts. rachel also provides a direct link to library research databases covering german literature so students are aware of high-quality sources for their papers. eight different instructors are teaching a new course in macro social work practice, coordinated by prof. katie mcguinness- dittrich. katie collaborated with the staff of the social work library (betty cohen, kate silfen, nancy adams and scott carlisle) to select and present a wide array of library resources to the 175 students enrolled in this required core course. for example, four required videos were digitized and made available online, so instructors had the option of showing the video in class or assigning it for viewing at home. legislative tracking skills were introduced to students by including a link to a new library resource, lexisnexis state capital . an online tutorial was created using camtasia software to teach students how to use this database to follow particular issues and bills introduced to the state legislature. several other library resources, tutorials and guides were included in this site. usage statistics and survey responses indicated that this collaboration was highly satisfactory to students and faculty. the webct site of a fine arts course, the age of leonardo and michelangelo, includes a customized, interactive bibliography of recent literature developed by adeane bregman, bapst art librarian, in collaboration with prof. stephanie leone. adeane used refworks, the online citation management software to develop the bibliography by importing citations from several arts and humanities research databases available at bc libraries. students were able to select articles for their papers from this bibliography and directly link from the bibliography to full-text online copies. adeane also added an online survey to assess students\u2019 use of the bibliography. the webct site also includes links to images of michelangelo\u2019s works selected from library image databases, such as artstor and bcdia , the boston college digital libraries collection. there are many other examples of successful collaborations between faculty and librarians to enhance the e-learning environment at boston college, including courses in music, law, western civilization, and the honors program. these projects were highlighted at a recent mini-conference held at boston college in december ( see related article ). these examples show how easy and effective it can be to enrich course webct sites with content derived from resources available at bc libraries. faculty can collaborate with their subject librarians to select appropriate materials for any course and explore ways to integrate them into course assignments and projects. special tutorials and research guides can be created to instruct students on use of the materials. webct tracking and assessment tools allow the instructor to evaluate the effectiveness of the resources in helping the students do their work. learn more about how to integrate library resources in webct by logging on to a webct site called \u201clibrary resources.\u201d this site demonstrates how to use all of webct tools to incorporate direct links to library resources for reading, viewing, listening, discussion, research and enrichment. to request access to this site, send an email to webct@bc.edu . for additional information, contact your subject librarian or the

each year, a handful of intrepid instructors from departments other than fine arts find their way to the fourth floor of devlin, and to the visual resources collection\u2019s slide library. those who do are often surprised to find more than 100,000 35-millimeter slides documenting the history of art and architecture. over the course of many decades, we have developed this collection to support the teaching needs of the fine arts faculty. many of the same images satisfy the occasional needs of faculty from other departments such as history, english, theology and romance languages. although instructors from throughout the university might find the slide library\u2019s holdings useful, those accustomed to the extended hours of (and the liberal borrowing privileges accorded to them by) the university library may find the slide library\u2019s more restrictive policies unfamiliar. funded and staffed as a departmental resource, and devoted to the teaching needs of the fine arts faculty, the slide library welcomes instructors from other boston college departments by appointment only. moreover, because it is organized for an expert user group (and, for the most part, is not searchable by means of a database), the collection can be difficult to navigate for those new to its particular features. \u201coutside\u201d users may borrow slides for only a few hours at a time, and, should conflicting needs arise, fine arts faculty members have priority. and the collection is unavailable to students, except those in a few upper-level fine arts seminars. thanks to changing technology and a fruitful partnership with the university library, however, the donato bramante: the tempietto (begun 1502), san pietro in montorio, rome. photograph copyright stephanie leone. visual resources collection can now share digital resources with all members of the university community, and also make it easier for non-experts to find art images. bcdia \u2013 boston college digital images of art \u2013 recently became available to all members of the university community, 24/7, from any on-campus desktop computer. you can search for images of art objects and monuments much as you do for books in the library\u2019s online catalog \u2013 by using keyword searches, or by searching on specific criteria such as the artist\u2019s name, the title or location of the work, or the type of object. if you find something that interests you, you can view the image \u2013 either as a standard jpeg, or as a high-resolution image that allows much closer examination of the object depicted. you may select specific records \u2014 with links to the images \u2014 to save during your current session; registered users can save and organize records for future use. the boston college libraries soon will be upgrading to the newest version of digitool, the software through which the library manages and distributes bcdia and other digital collections. version 3 will allow registered users to save records in what digitool calls \u201cmy space\u201d folders. records in my space folders may be shared with others (for instance, students or colleagues), and it is also possible to upload images from other sources and integrate them into a my space folder. moreover, the new version of digitool will provide built-in viewers for classroom display of images. of course, there are other viewing options \u2014 users may download jpeg images from bcdia for display using presentation programs such as powerpoint or artstor\u2019s offline image viewer, or create links from their own web or webct pages to specific images in bcdia. bcdia currently contains over 2300 images of art and architecture, primarily of the western world. an initial grant enabled the visual resources collection to jump-start its digital library with a purchase of two large sets of digital images \u2013 the first corresponding to objects illustrated in a standard history of western art textbook, and the second to an italian renaissance art textbook. we have since supplemented these initial images with smaller sets of contemporary architecture, and additional images of italian renaissance and baroque art and architecture as photographed by members of the fine arts faculty. as a result, bcdia is now especially rich in this area. as increasing numbers of vendors and photographers make digital images available, we will continue to develop the collection, both broadening and deepening its coverage. the resources in bcdia complement those available through the library\u2019s subscription to artstor. with over 300,000 images, artstor is far larger than bcdia. but since bcdia is a boston college collection, we have more control over its content, and can focus collection development to support our curriculum and the specific needs of our faculty. images from bcdia may be combined in presentations with images from artstor using artstor\u2019s offline image viewer software. artstor and bcdia images share similar terms of use \u2013 essentially, members of the boston college community may use the images for teaching, study and research purposes at boston college, or when presenting a paper at an off-site conference at which the speaker is presenting as a member of the boston college community. images may not be used for publication unless you seek and receive permission to do so from the copyright holder. please see how may i use the images in bcdia? and quick guide to uses of the artstor digital library for more information on permitted uses of these two resources. the fine arts department welcomes the opportunity to share bcdia with the university community as a result of our partnership with the university library. but bcdia is only one example of an exciting revolution in resource sharing made possible by means of technology. nearly every department at boston college houses unique resources that can enhance the teaching or research activities of faculty members and students elsewhere in the university \u2013 or even outside of it. the university library\u2019s information-management experts help us liberate these resources from their local confines, and advance scholarship by building bridges among our ivory towers. andrea frank curator of visual resources, fine arts department links more information about bcdia link to bcdia artstor questions, comments?

college libraries newsletter volume 7 number 2 spring 2006 bringing the library into the e-learning environment course webct sites are proving to be prime locations for access to course-specific online library resources. by presenting links in webct course sites to well-chosen, high-quality online books, journal articles, databases, tutorials, research guides and other scholarly materials, faculty can encourage students to use resources that will enable them to improve their research skills and locate higher quality sources for their papers and research projects. digitized books, films, audio files, and images can also be added to webct sites to provide direct access to primary source materials. a first step is as simple as providing a direct link to the online course reserves. faculty who provide their syllabi or reading lists to the bc libraries course reserves staff can request that a link be added to the course site. students can then click directly from the site to their required journal articles and single chapter readings in full text. students can also locate these readings in the course reserves catalog in quest, but a link in webct allows students to view the syllabus, course materials and the reserve readings from the same location. contact the reserves staff at oneill.reserves@bc.edu to set up online course reserves or to add this link to your courses. students in the history of german literature class taught by prof. rachel freudenberg have been pleased with the availability in their webct site of direct links to the bc libraries\u2019 full-text online editions of works by brecht and goethe. students can print out the assigned chapters and make notes, comments, and translations directly on their printouts. rachel also provides a direct link to library research databases covering german literature so students are aware of high-quality sources for their papers. eight different instructors are teaching a new course in macro social work practice, coordinated by prof. katie mcguinness- dittrich. katie collaborated with the staff of the social work library (betty cohen, kate silfen, nancy adams and scott carlisle) to select and present a wide array of library resources to the 175 students enrolled in this required core course. for example, four required videos were digitized and made available online, so instructors had the option of showing the video in class or assigning it for viewing at home. legislative tracking skills were introduced to students by including a link to a new library resource, lexisnexis state capital . an online tutorial was created using camtasia software to teach students how to use this database to follow particular issues and bills introduced to the state legislature. several other library resources, tutorials and guides were included in this site. usage statistics and survey responses indicated that this collaboration was highly satisfactory to students and faculty. the webct site of a fine arts course, the age of leonardo and michelangelo, includes a customized, interactive bibliography of recent literature developed by adeane bregman, bapst art librarian, in collaboration with prof. stephanie leone. adeane used refworks, the online citation management software to develop the bibliography by importing citations from several arts and humanities research databases available at bc libraries. students were able to select articles for their papers from this bibliography and directly link from the bibliography to full-text online copies. adeane also added an online survey to assess students\u2019 use of the bibliography. the webct site also includes links to images of michelangelo\u2019s works selected from library image databases, such as artstor and bcdia , the boston college digital libraries collection. there are many other examples of successful collaborations between faculty and librarians to enhance the e-learning environment at boston college, including courses in music, law, western civilization, and the honors program. these projects were highlighted at a recent mini-conference held at boston college in december ( see related article ). these examples show how easy and effective it can be to enrich course webct sites with content derived from resources available at bc libraries. faculty can collaborate with their subject librarians to select appropriate materials for any course and explore ways to integrate them into course assignments and projects. special tutorials and research guides can be created to instruct students on use of the materials. webct tracking and assessment tools allow the instructor to evaluate the effectiveness of the resources in helping the students do their work. learn more about how to integrate library resources in webct by logging on to a webct site called \u201clibrary resources.\u201d this site demonstrates how to use all of webct tools to incorporate direct links to library resources for reading, viewing, listening, discussion, research and enrichment. to request access to this site, send an email to webct@bc.edu . for additional information, contact your subject

area highlight: legal resources from o\u2019neill library o\u2019neill library has print and online subscriptions to many legal resources. print materials at the law school library are available to everyone in the boston college community; however, many of their online legal databases are contractually restricted to current law school students and faculty. o\u2019neill library has subscriptions to the two leading legal databases, lexis-nexis and westlaw; these databases are available to all current boston college students, faculty and staff. the o\u2019neill subscriptions are for the academic versions of these products and do not include some of the specialized legal documents available in the law school versions, but they do have basic legal documents such as federal and state cases, current laws and secondary legal materials. they also contain legal documents from the european union and extensive non-legal news. some of the unique features of lexis-nexis academic can be found in the commonwealth and foreign nations section which includes cases from canada, ireland, australia, mexico, hong kong, uk, and south africa along with treaties and international agreements. lexis-nexis academic also has a section on tax law which includes the internal revenue code, treasury regulations and the full text of many tax related journals. westlaw campus research has a major legal encyclopedia, american jurisprudence, and american law reports (alr) which contain articles called annotations summarizing the law on a particular issue. another difference between lexis-nexis academic and westlaw campus research is their interfaces. westlaw campus research has a simple menu and allows you to choose your search method. westlaw defaults to a \u201cnatural language\u201d meaning that it will find documents that are most likely to be relevant to your search by using statistical relevancy. this is an easy way to start legal research. the drawback in westlaw campus is that before printing you must download the document. lexis-nexis academic is a bit more difficult to use, but has easier printing options. both databases allow documents to be emailed. the boston college community does have access to several legal databases provided by the law school. these include two indexes - the index to legal periodicals and legaltrac . indexes are often a good way to start legal research. we also have access to hein online which provides access to the full text of legal periodicals with a focus on retrospective coverage not available in other databases, many pre-1980. the law school library also provides access to the electronic version of the religion case reporter , which reports and indexes federal and state judicial opinions addressing the free exercise of religion, state establishment of religion, the clergy and religious institutions. a legal title owned by o\u2019neill library, but not by the law library, is the education law reporter (o\u2019neill reference kf3110 .a2 w47) which covers selected state and federal education cases from 1982 to date and includes summaries of grants, awards and regulations from the u.s. department of education, as well as articles authored by education experts. other print titles in the o\u2019neill collection are the labor law reporter (o\u2019neill reference hd6508 .c658) and the arms control reporter (o\u2019neill reference jx1974. a73), a chronicle of treaties, negotiations, and proposals. o\u2019neill library also has electronic subscriptions to other law related materials such as congressional universe , which provides access to hearing transcripts, congressional committee reports, bills, public laws, selected committee prints, congressional documents, the congressional record from the 99th congress to the present; cq supreme court collection , which has historical analysis, recent updates, and expert commentary about supreme court decisions, justices, institutional history; and several other databases from cq (congressional quarterly). to access the online databases go to the boston college libraries\u2019 homepage and click on \u201conline databases\u201d. if

libraries newsletter volume 7 number 2 spring 2006 bcdia: boston college digital images of art each year, a handful of intrepid instructors from departments other than fine arts find their way to the fourth floor of devlin, and to the visual resources collection\u2019s slide library. those who do are often surprised to find more than 100,000 35-millimeter slides documenting the history of art and architecture. over the course of many decades, we have developed this collection to support the teaching needs of the fine arts faculty. many of the same images satisfy the occasional needs of faculty from other departments such as history, english, theology and romance languages. although instructors from throughout the university might find the slide library\u2019s holdings useful, those accustomed to the extended hours of (and the liberal borrowing privileges accorded to them by) the university library may find the slide library\u2019s more restrictive policies unfamiliar. funded and staffed as a departmental resource, and devoted to the teaching needs of the fine arts faculty, the slide library welcomes instructors from other boston college departments by appointment only. moreover, because it is organized for an expert user group (and, for the most part, is not searchable by means of a database), the collection can be difficult to navigate for those new to its particular features. \u201coutside\u201d users may borrow slides for only a few hours at a time, and, should conflicting needs arise, fine arts faculty members have priority. and the collection is unavailable to students, except those in a few upper-level fine arts seminars. thanks to changing technology and a fruitful partnership with the university library, however, the donato bramante: the tempietto (begun 1502), san pietro in montorio, rome. photograph copyright stephanie leone. visual resources collection can now share digital resources with all members of the university community, and also make it easier for non-experts to find art images. bcdia \u2013 boston college digital images of art \u2013 recently became available to all members of the university community, 24/7, from any on-campus desktop computer. you can search for images of art objects and monuments much as you do for books in the library\u2019s online catalog \u2013 by using keyword searches, or by searching on specific criteria such as the artist\u2019s name, the title or location of the work, or the type of object. if you find something that interests you, you can view the image \u2013 either as a standard jpeg, or as a high-resolution image that allows much closer examination of the object depicted. you may select specific records \u2014 with links to the images \u2014 to save during your current session; registered users can save and organize records for future use. the boston college libraries soon will be upgrading to the newest version of digitool, the software through which the library manages and distributes bcdia and other digital collections. version 3 will allow registered users to save records in what digitool calls \u201cmy space\u201d folders. records in my space folders may be shared with others (for instance, students or colleagues), and it is also possible to upload images from other sources and integrate them into a my space folder. moreover, the new version of digitool will provide built-in viewers for classroom display of images. of course, there are other viewing options \u2014 users may download jpeg images from bcdia for display using presentation programs such as powerpoint or artstor\u2019s offline image viewer, or create links from their own web or webct pages to specific images in bcdia. bcdia currently contains over 2300 images of art and architecture, primarily of the western world. an initial grant enabled the visual resources collection to jump-start its digital library with a purchase of two large sets of digital images \u2013 the first corresponding to objects illustrated in a standard history of western art textbook, and the second to an italian renaissance art textbook. we have since supplemented these initial images with smaller sets of contemporary architecture, and additional images of italian renaissance and baroque art and architecture as photographed by members of the fine arts faculty. as a result, bcdia is now especially rich in this area. as increasing numbers of vendors and photographers make digital images available, we will continue to develop the collection, both broadening and deepening its coverage. the resources in bcdia complement those available through the library\u2019s subscription to artstor. with over 300,000 images, artstor is far larger than bcdia. but since bcdia is a boston college collection, we have more control over its content, and can focus collection development to support our curriculum and the specific needs of our faculty. images from bcdia may be combined in presentations with images from artstor using artstor\u2019s offline image viewer software. artstor and bcdia images share similar terms of use \u2013 essentially, members of the boston college community may use the images for teaching, study and research purposes at boston college, or when presenting a paper at an off-site conference at which the speaker is presenting as a member of the boston college community. images may not be used for publication unless you seek and receive permission to do so from the copyright holder. please see how may i use the images in bcdia? and quick guide to uses of the artstor digital library for more information on permitted uses of these two resources. the fine arts department welcomes the opportunity to share bcdia with the university community as a result of our partnership with the university library. but bcdia is only one example of an exciting revolution in resource sharing made possible by means of technology. nearly every department at boston college houses unique resources that can enhance the teaching or research activities of faculty members and students elsewhere in the university \u2013 or even outside of it. the university library\u2019s information-management experts help us liberate these resources from their local confines, and advance scholarship by building bridges among our ivory towers. andrea frank

honoring the centennial of the birth of acclaimed irish playwright samuel beckett is now on display at boston college's john j. burns library of rare books and special collections. the free public exhibit, titled \"\u2026my monster is in safe keeping,\" will be on view throughout the main exhibit floor of burns library through january 31, 2007. the exclusive exhibit, which includes items never before displayed in the united states, is comprised of correspondence, manuscripts, posters, photographs, publications and other papers by and about samuel beckett (1906-1989), winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1969 and noted for works that include \"waiting for godot.\" the exhibit is drawn from boston college's celebrated beckett collection, considered to be one of the world's finest . it is comprised of more than 400 manuscripts and other pieces collected by the playwright's friends calvin and joann israel, as well as correspondence between beckett and north american literary agent barney rosett, correspondence with director alan schneider, and correspondence in french between beckett and swiss-born french novelist and playwright robert pinget. at right, a grouping of documents and photographs related to the beckett plays \"endgame,\" \"krapp's last tape\" and \"happy days.\" the exhibit is in celebration not only of the centennial of beckett's birth but also of a new burns library acquisition: the judith schmidt douw collection of correspondence with samuel beckett, 1957-1984, which contains more than 130 letters from beckett to judith schmidt (later judith schmidt douw), secretary to barney rosett of grove press, beckett's american publisher. \"this exhibit gives boston college an opportunity not only to celebrate the life of the great irish playwright and novelist samuel beckett but also to showcase the university's latest beckett acquisition, the nearly 30-year correspondence between samuel beckett and judith schmidt douw,\" said bc's burns librarian robert o'neill. \"this collection significantly strengthens the american beckett collection, already well represented at burns library by the israel, schneider and rosett collections.\" in addition to letters from the newly-acquired schmidt douw collection, the exhibit includes the rare beckett manuscript \"suite\" (later called \"la fin\") written in 1946, said exhibit curator robert bruns. \"it was during the course of this manuscript that beckett switched from writing in english to french, which may have marked the point at which he started writing extended prose works in french.\" also on display are several of the letters from beckett to alan schneider on how to direct his plays, schneider's letter to thornton wilder describing his first meeting with beckett, and rare posters from openings of beckett plays, including the original production of \"en attendant godot\" (\"waiting for godot\") at the theatre de babylon in paris, shown at left. in addition, the exhibit includes several examples of boston college's extensive collection of signed beckett publications from the israel beckett collection, annotated typescripts of early versions of novels and plays, and a typescript of beckett's prize-winning 1930 poem, \"whoroscope.\" the exhibit title, \"\u2026my monster is in safe keeping,\" is a quote drawn from a letter, shown at right , in the collection from beckett to alan schneider. on december 14, 1955, beckett wrote, \"having worked with you so pleasantly and, i hope, profitably, in paris and london, i feel my monster is in safe keeping.\" he was referring to his play \"waiting for godot,\" which schneider was to direct in the united states. the samuel beckett collection at burns library is one of the hallmarks of boston college's renowned irish collection, considered to be the premier, most comprehensive collection of irish research material in the united states. also housed at burns library, the collection documents the history, life and culture of the irish people, with strong holdings in irish history, religion and politics, and significant collections related to some of ireland's greatest writers. the john j. burns library of rare books and special collections at boston college is named in memory of the honorable john j. burns, a 1921 bc alumnus who was one of its principal benefactors. it houses more than 160,000 volumes, 15 million manuscripts and impressive holdings of artifacts, maps, paintings, photographs, ephemera and arc hitectural records. free and open to the public. hours:

volume 8 number 1 fall 2006 rapid delivery of journal articles to your desktop have you wondered how copies of articles from journals we don\u2019t own at boston college get to your desktop so fast? or wondered what the interlibrary loan staff located in o\u2019neill and the law library do behind the scenes to fill your requests? they have many resources at their fingertips but are also continually examining new software and systems to make requesting easier and to decrease the turn around time for the article requests you make. one recent initiative undertaken to improve service is a membership in an organization called rapid . the boston college libraries, together with colleagues in the boston library consortium (blc), began using rapid for borrowing and lending journal articles in august. this unique resource sharing system is comprised of hardware, software, and a relational database located at colorado state university's morgan library. a key component of rapid is that participants agree to adhere to a 24-hour turnaround time when filling journal requests. what does this mean to you? you do not have to make any changes in the way you place requests. when a request is placed for a journal article through an online form and/or via find it, or when you monitor your requests through your interlibrary loan account, you will see no difference. what you may see is a faster turn around time from when you request an item to when the item is sent to your email. all requests filled for you through rapid must be sent electronically \u2013 no paper copies are sent snail mail in this system. we began using rapid in mid-august and will have to wait several months to see what all the positive effects may be. during the first 6 weeks use of rapid , 701 requests were placed for boston college users. the system automatically selects the library to fill your request so even if boston university has the item, the request may go to colorado state. it makes no difference since requests are filled electronically, using the internet to transport the journal articles. boston college is participating in rapid as a member of the blc which includes boston university, brandeis university, brown university, mit, tufts, university of massachusetts/amherst, williams college, and others. rapid membership also expands our reciprocal agreements to include other members of the association of research libraries (arl), including columbia university, cornell university, notre dame, rutgers, university of pennsylvania, university of michigan, a number of law libraries, and others. the interlibrary loan staffs (in o\u2019neill and at the law library) already pride themselves on fast turn around time and excel in customer service - joining rapid enhances their ability to continue this high level of service. any questions you may have about rapid or interlibrary loan in general can be sent to either ill@bc.edu or lawill@bc.edu . margie

over the summer, the library was engaged in a long overdue process of removing duplicate print indexes to periodical articles from the reference and/or library collections. the reference department adopted the following policy: print indexing and abstracting titles that duplicate online content will be canceled. existing print copies of duplicate index and abstracting content will be weeded from the reference collection. a subject specialist who determines that a duplicate print subscription is still necessary has two options: demonstrate the added value a print index offers to justify its remaining in the reference collection. access to the index when the network is down is not an added value argument. these titles will be evaluated on a title-by-title basis. shelve the index in the general collection. the reasoning behind the policy is fourfold: 1. library space: the way in which the user accesses library collections has changed dramatically in the electronic age. we face the challenge of balancing the primary (and exploding) mode of access to collections (electronic) with multiple expectations for the use of the physical library. we are obligated to design the library to meet both the traditional and the newer and expanding needs. by freeing up space where duplicated indexes were shelved, we can introduce new uses and meet some of the stated needs of our users, while still providing quality online access to journal literature. 2. budget: the library\u2019s acquisitions budget has steadily eroded in purchasing power and we need to be savvy in our management of it. paying for duplicative content when we have a choice is not efficient. paying for duplicate content that is not used is even less efficient. monies saved from canceled duplicated print indexes can be used to enhance the collections in other ways. 3. limitations: we must face the reality of our fiscal and space issues. these decisions are difficult, but they must be made if we are to continue to develop relevant services and collections for current and future users. 4. use: the print indexes are not used, they are not the preferred method of access, and we have a stable network, which maximizes online use. we understand that the electronic resources field is dynamic (and this can be unnerving), but we also believe that access to the journal literature is a vital component and that long-term access to journal content via online publications will be secure. ed tallent head, reference & instruction questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe

number 1 fall 2006 federal research public access act of 2006 in may, 2006 senators john cornyn (r-tx) and joseph lieberman (d-ct) introduced the bipartisan frpaa ( federal research public access act ). this act would require that us government agencies with annual extramural research expenditures of over $100 million to make manuscripts of journal articles stemming from research funded by that agency publicly available via the internet. the manuscripts would be maintained in a stable digital repository, either the agency\u2019s own or another that facilitates free public access, interoperability, and long-term preservation. the agency would be obliged to provide free online public access to these final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions not later than 6 months after publication in peer-reviewed journals. in a floor speech of the us senate on 2 may, 2006 senator cornyn said: \u201cour bill simply says to all researchers who seek government funding that we want the results of your work to be seen by the largest possible audience. it will ensure that us taxpayers do not have to pay twice for the same research \u2013 once to conduct it, and a second time to read it.\u201d not surprisingly frpaa has received strong support from academia. numerous university and college presidents, provosts and other senior administrators have registered their support. for example, in late july twenty-five university provosts (some very major universities included) released an open letter to the higher education community in support of frpaa. the authors, observing that about 50% of university research funding originates with the federal government, state categorically that \u201cfrpaa is good for education and good for research. it is good for the american public, and it promotes broad, democratic access to knowledge.\u201d on 6 september, 2006 the presidents of fifty-six liberal arts colleges also issued a letter supporting frpaa . in praising frpaa the presidents write: \u201cadoption of the federal research public access act will democratize access to research information funded by tax dollars. it will benefit education, research, and the general public. we urge the higher education community, american taxpayers, and members of congress to support its passage into law.\u201d on 19 september, 2006 six public land-grant universities in new england, also issued a letter in support of frpaa. the letter is signed by the chief academic officers from the universities of connecticut, maine, massachusetts amherst, new hampshire, rhode island, and vermont. in this letter to senator cornyn they write: \u201copen access to publicly funded research facilitates the candid discussion needed to accelerate research, share knowledge, improve treatment of diseases, and increase human understanding. your bill is a crucial step in realizing this goal, and we look forward to working with you to secure the bill\u2019s passage. . .\u201d nevertheless, many professional and scholarly publishers are strongly critical of frpaa as is evident in a 9 may, 2006 10 may commentary on the aap\u2019s press release that it is likely that frpaa will not be detrimental to subscriptions. however, he cogently argues that even if frpaa results in loss of revenue for publishers \u201cthe public interest takes precedence. the mission of the publicly-funded research agencies is to advance science and research, not to protect the revenues of private-sector businesses.\u201d in the fall 2005 issue of the library newsletter i wrote of the nih public access policy that requested all nih-funded investigators to deposit their final manuscripts in pubmed central 12 months after the official date of final publication. because self-archiving was not mandated the nih policy was arguably doomed to failure. only about 4% of eligible articles were archived. consequently, the mandating element of frpaa (within six months and not twelve) promises far greater success in having scholarly articles disseminated freely. moreover, many more disciplines are now covered by frpaa and not just those coming under the rubric of the nih. in addition, the researcher\u2019s own institutional repository may be appropriate for archiving the document once it satisfies the conditions of free public access, interoperability, and long-term preservation. it is not limited to a central archive. more information about frpaa may be accessed on the arl sparc page federal research public access act of 2006 (s.2695) . in closing, may i remind boston college authors that they do not have to wait until there is a government mandate to deposit their published articles in an institutional or disciplinary digital repository. once such articles do not run counter to copyright restrictions that may be imposed by the journals\u2019 publishers, they may be deposited in boston college libraries\u2019 escholarship@bc . moreover, articles deposited in escholarship@bc are by no means limited to those whose research has been funded by the federal government. for more information please contact mark caprio , escholarship program manager.

and students at boston college are relying more and more heavily on electronic journals for research. as a result, the boston college libraries have been investing substantially more in e-journal subscriptions. during the spring 2005 semester, librarians worked closely with faculty to cancel about 700 print journals while retaining access to their e-journal versions. this project was necessitated by sharp increases in journal costs, and the decision to control journal expenditures by reducing duplication between print and electronic versions of the same information. the rapid growth of a journal collection that is available only electronically raises a critical concern: whether or not researchers can rely on continuing access to e-journals as surely as they have relied on their print counterparts. will currently subscribed e-journals be available a hundred years from now? for many years, librarians have had little choice but to negotiate licenses with e-journal publishers which included \u201cperpetual access\u201d guarantees. this solution was considered to be less than adequate, because the responsibility of preserving information has traditionally been assumed by libraries. a new approach to archiving e-journals needed to be developed. recognizing the urgent need for a dependable safety net for its e-journal collection, the boston college libraries now subscribe to two e-journal archiving services, portico and lockss (a felicitous acronym for lots of copies keeps stuff safe). although each operates differently, they both offer significant alternatives to archiving by publishers. portico started as part of jstor , a scholarly journal archive that has been around for years. lockss was begun by stanford university and is now used by research libraries around the world. an essential element needed for the success of lockss and portico is publisher participation, and the good news is that major journal publishers like elsevier, oxford university press, and sage are signing agreements with one or both of these services to permit their publications to be archived. for more information about the issues involved in archiving e-journals, the following online statement by the digital library foundation provides a useful summary: urgent action needed to preserve scholarly electronic journals (september 2005) . this statement

"http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2006fall/OPAC/index.html", "text": "boston college libraries newsletter volume 8 number 1 fall 2006 quest, present and future s ince the beginning of the twentieth century, library catalogs have been constructed according to a set of principles and techniques that has remained largely unchanged. from the 3 x 5 card stored in wooden catalog card drawers through the early automated catalogs and on to the current web-based opacs (online public access catalogs), a catalog record provides descriptive data and a series of access points, or browsable index entries, under author names, titles, series, and subjects. keyword searching and limiters such as date, format, and location have given users added techniques to locate needed materials. more recently, the ability to link directly to an electronic resource has enabled the catalog to deliver the full text of a resource to the user\u2019s desktop. and yet users prefer to search for information resources on the web rather than in our opacs. recent and dramatic changes in our collections, in technology, and in user expectations have encouraged discussion on the role and scope of the opac. our library catalogs have always described our collections as containers or bundles of content: books, journal titles, physical media. reference collections held printed indexes to periodical articles and individual works of poetry, book reviews, essays, etc. but the collection is no longer in the library. physical collections are stored offsite; scholarly materials are in repositories and open archives; authoritative resources are scattered on the web; e-journals and databases are on vendor and publisher websites. the opac no longer represents the full range of scholarly and research information available to the university community. library automated systems were designed initially for inventory management: acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation. the marc (machine readable cataloging) format was developed in the 1960\u2019s to support the exchange of catalog records and the printing of catalog cards. while marc has proved extremely durable and adaptable, other encoding standards, or metadata schema, have developed outside the library to support the electronic exchange of information. these schema are both simpler and more detailed than marc, serving the specific needs of their communities: the publishing industry, museums and archives, and specialized collections. there is much research and development on \u201ccrosswalks,\u201d or conversion routines, to map one metadata schema to another (including marc). but given the fragmentation of our collections noted above, it is worth asking whether we should be converting metadata into marc in order to include it in our opac, or finding ways to build on the strengths of these specialized schemes through improved search interfaces. the public has learned to interact comfortably with the electronic world. users have taken control of searching and exploring on their own through their preferred interface. they participate actively in creating content and sharing it with other users. the availability of full-text resources has made it possible for users to seek the most granular, or specific, level of information rather than our traditional \u201cbundles.\u201d for many users, the process of discovery, or search, is a means; delivery of content is the goal. but the discovery process is greatly improved when it relies on descriptive metadata to retrieve and rank results in a meaningful way. how can we improve the user experience in our opac and still take advantage of the rich descriptive data and expert categorization and classification created by catalogers? search engine on top of the library system, using cataloging and other metadata to present results in new ways. enrich the data in the catalog record by adding tables of contents, reviews, and images to maximize successful retrievals. provide active feedback to suggest alternate searches, correct spelling, and link to the best source of full text. cluster results in hierarchical or graphical ways that make relationships clear and suggest paths to refining the search. and link, link, link \u2026 the cataloged collection to repositories to journal articles to digital objects to

welcome donations of all types of recorded information that support the university's curricular and research programs. prospective donors should consult with the collection development department head in o\u2019neill library or the librarian contacts listed below when planning to donate books and other printed or recorded material. materials that are judged to be more suitable to our special collections are referred to the associate university librarian for special collections . all offers of gifts receive careful consideration and are evaluated in terms of the collection development goals of the libraries. these include: supporting the current and evolving curriculum, supporting the research needs of faculty and students, maintaining and enhancing older collections in depth. materials appropriate for the collection include: scholarly monographs, hardbound or good quality paperback music compact discs and scores videos, dvd's. depending on the number of volumes being offered to a library, an on-site evaluation of the collection by the appropriate subject bibliographer may take place before a determination to accept can be made. the libraries encourage donors to obtain an independent appraisal of the gift's value for income tax purposes. because the libraries are the receiving parties, federal regulations prohibit our supplying a dollar value to the gift. the libraries will, however, assist in identifying appraisers for this purpose. donors may wish to consult their personal attorney or tax advisor for further information and legal advice. the libraries will not accept gifts on which a donor places restrictions that will negatively affect the use of the materials. the libraries will acknowledge all gifts as to number and subject. we will also acknowledge a list supplied by the donor and a dollar estimate, if provided. upon receipt of a gift, the materials become the property of the boston college libraries. the libraries reserve the right to determine the retention and disposition of all gift materials. those materials not added to the collections will be disposed of at the discretion of the libraries. gifts delivered directly to the libraries without prior communication with one of the contacts listed below will not be accepted. bapst art library: adeane bregman art bibliographer 617-552-3136 | bregman@bc.edu educational resource

french, german, russian, and spanish are now available to the bc community. choice, a major book review journal for academic publications used by librarians, declared that oldo was \"the most exciting electronic language dictionary service since the debut of the online oxford english dictionary\" (choice, march 2008). each bilingual language dictionary, updated once a year, is accompanied by a number of resources designed to enhance language learning. for example, its tools and resources section includes numerous items grouped under the four headings of life and culture, grammar and vocabulary, writing and word games, and teaching and learning. highly recommended: the powerpoint tour created by the oxford university press to introduce users to oldo's many features. by the way, the reviews in choice are also available on online to the bc community. professors in search of material for their students or their own research can search it by subject, readership level (lower undergraduate, upper undergraduate, graduate, research/faculty, professional), and recommendation level (essential, highly recommended, recommended, optional, not recommended). both books and internet resources are reviewed. two histories of boston college available as e-books anticipating the 2013 sesquicentennial, the university libraries recently digitized two boston college histories. the digitization was accomplished through a partnership with the boston library consortium and the open content alliance . the two histories, freely available on the internet, are (1) rev. charles f. donovan's history of boston college: from the beginnings to 1990 , published in 1990 and (2) rev. david r. dunigan's earlier work, a history of boston college , published in 1947. the new electronic texts are cataloged in the libraries' holmes one search catalog and can also be accessed through the internet archive's web site: http://www.archive.org . the newly digitized histories join several related works freely available on the internet as a result of library digital initiatives: rev. charles f. donovan's occasional papers , a series of booklets published by the university historian, father donovan, which draw upon historical sources to document little-known aspects of boston college's history. boston college graduate school of arts and sciences: continuity and change at the heart of boston college , a brief history recording growth of graduate education at boston college during the last 80 years. mary kinnane. a dynamic era in the history of boston college: the higher education of undergraduate women, the school of education, 1952-1965 (2002) , a personal account of the early years of coeducation in the school of education\u2014the first school at bc to admit women. this work covers the years 1952-65 and includes profiles of faculty members and administrators. alerting services at boston college many members of the boston college community take advantage of alerting services to track the latest news in particular areas of interest. most journal publishers now provide rss (really simple syndication) options for automatic delivery of tables-of-contents and other news items to a user's rss reader. many other websites (blogs, newspaper portals - science of the times , for example, etc.) also provide this option. to begin receiving rss feeds, set up an rss reader (google reader is one example), then navigate to the journal or website page and look for the rss feed option to add the feed url to your reader ( more information ). boston college libraries also offers many databases providing rss feeds or email alerts from the journals they index, often allowing for customized searches. databases such as web of science (science citation index, social sciences citation index and arts and humanities citation index), business source complete, psycinfo, pubmed, to name just a few, let you create search strategies to fit your needs, then automatically send you results as either email or rss alerts whenever articles appear matching your requirements. for a more extensive list of databases and journals offering email and rss alerts, see the libraries' page, set up automated alerts (e-alerts) for databases and e-journals . you now have an additional option at boston college, refaware . refaware brings the power of rss feeds into your email inbox, offering a central access point for customized search alerts over a wide swath of disciplines. refaware indexes over 8,000 scholarly journals and non-refereed information sources. searches can be run against broad journal subject categories (life sciences, biology, and medicine; physical sciences; engineering; social sciences; arts & humanities; and business), or further limited to results from a customized journal set. all journals included in the service must offer an rss feed option. if a journal you follow offers rss, but is not included, you can request its addition to the service. users can establish up to 30 customized searches, and set delivery frequency between daily and quarterly. export the results you want to keep to refworks, endnote or refmanager (select this in preferences). references remain in the website for 90 days. scientific american is now one of the nature journals scientific american , the magazine long known for making science and technology accessible to the wide array of users, scientists and non-scientists, alike, is now part of the nature publishing group (npg) stable of journals. the libraries' ejournals page provides immediate access to the full-text and abundant graphics for issues published since 1993. scientific american mind and other supplemental series can also be found here. updated: october 13,

collections > current page: collection development collection development research mission in the last twenty years, the number of volumes in the library collections at boston college has doubled with a total volume count of over two million. as a member of the association of research libraries , the libraries' mission has always been to support the teaching and research efforts of boston college. the university has made a commitment to develop its research programs, become more of a national and international academic institution, and diversify its student population while maintaining its traditional excellence in undergraduate teaching. this commitment has implications for the kinds of information resources students and faculty require. during a time of technological innovation in publishing and information delivery, the boston college libraries are developing a digital library of electronic resources essential to current academic scholarship and teaching. at the same time, the libraries continue to add to the collections of books, journals, microforms, videos, and other kinds of materials which form the historic foundation of library holdings. how we select and acquire research materials many of the print books acquired by the libraries are received through approval plans with domestic and foreign vendors. the approval plans, which are continually being updated by boston college librarians, reflect the subject areas that are being researched and taught at boston college. books are also ordered on a title-by-title basis based on information from reviews, catalogues, publisher notices, and recommendations received from library users. periodicals are ordered and subscriptions renewed via serial vendors. because of continuing sharp increases in subscription prices, new periodical orders must be paid for by cancellation of current subscriptions. new journals are ordered in the electronic version if both print and electronic are available unless there is a reason for preferring print. either books or periodicals can be recommended by sending an e-mail message to the appropriate subject specialist . electronic resources like online databases and electronic journals are selected because of recommendations from faculty and students at boston college as well as information provided by database vendors and library consortia. because of the expensive nature of electronic resources, library consortia like the boston library consortium (blc) and the northeast regional libraries (nerl) have worked with vendors to get discounted prices. as a result, consortial agreements for electronic resources now play an important role in developing our electronic collections. the boston college community is invited to try out potential new databases by visiting the trials page . the process for selecting new electronic resources begins with subject specialists who may have received recommendations from faculty or students, considered offers made by e-resource vendors, or heard about special deals being offered to library consortia. the subject specialist must evaluate the resource according to standards stated in the electronic resources collection policy. a form is submitted to the electronic resource review board, a group composed of librarians from a range of library departments, which considers any technological and budgetary issues connected with the resource. if funds are available and the resource presents no technological difficulties, the resource is ordered. other formats like music cds, dvds, and microforms among others are selected and ordered on a title by title basis. please contact your subject specialist if you have specific recommendations. balancing the collections until the last decade of the 20th century, academic library collections were primarily composed of print materials. the selection of books and periodicals followed familiar procedures, and budgets were based on years of experience with the teaching and research needs of the university on the one hand and publishing trends on the other. however, the advent of electronic resources and the rising demand for their availability have transformed the work of collection development. the basic goal remains: to provide the boston college community with the resources it needs for pursuing academic excellence. the libraries' collection development program has always strived to provide information in the most appropriate formats. the addition of electronic resources has added a degree of complexity to the task, but subject specialists working closely with faculty and students will continue to select and acquire the best possible combination of print, electronic, and other formats. balancing the collections has become, more than ever before, a collaborative effort. updated: october 31, 2012 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston

collections growing at boston college academic e-books have been a heavily-used part of the boston college libraries collections for a number of years, in the form of such important e-book collections as eebo (early english books online), the atla historical monographs , cambridge histories online , cambridge companions complete , wiley\u2019s chemistry of the functional groups , early american imprints , eighteenth century collections online , oxford digital reference shelf , past masters online , and sage reference online e-books are increasingly recognized as having certain important benefits over print books: for reference use (for encyclopedic information, data and other facts); for multi-authored books, where the individual chapter is the segment of interest, and where the user would be unlikely to read from cover-to-cover; and for monographs, where multimedia can greatly enhance the experience and the information conveyed (by inclusion of audio or video clips, etc.) e-books also have the great advantage of offering remote access \u2013 at any time of day. the libraries are careful in their selection of e-book products, with relevant content being uppermost, and preference given to products offering the following licensing terms: purchase (rather than subscription, with its attendant on-going costs); favorable digital rights management (ensuring that the license provides users the ability to print/download meaningful segments of a work, i.e. not limited to page-by-page printing, according to fair use guidelines of u.s. copyright law; and provisions for perpetual access. third-party agents, such as portico , are now working with many major publishers to preserve e-book content, an option previously limited to e-journal content. in the past, purchasing options for libraries were largely limited to e-book collections where libraries had little or no choice but to purchase desired as well as less-desirable titles. in more recent years, however, publishers and vendors have responded to the need for individual selection, and options for granular title purchase selection have now appeared. the boston college libraries have contracted with ebrary for this type of individual title selection, and are purchasing more titles in this way, while continuing to purchase important publisher collections, where appropriate. in the sciences, the major scientific, technical, and medical (stm) publishers have moved aggressively into e-books, introducing some innovative business models. elsevier publishing, for example, now offers the product, \u201cevidence-based selection\u201d, providing access to selected, full e-book collections for a 12-month period. at the end of that time, libraries can invest that cost in purchasing individual titles either from that collection or from others, but now with the benefit of knowledge of individual use history. in response to growing interest in this subject from many sectors, the boston college libraries have purchased access to the elsevier \u201cebs\u201d collection for environmental studies books pre-2007 through 2009. updated: april 5, 2011 maintained by: university

process. writing tutors at the cflc are undergraduate and graduate peer tutors. most are english or liberal arts majors. they all attend training to help them provide constructive criticism throughout the writing process. writing tutors are in high academic standing and have been recommended as tutors by their professors. in order to best accommodate all students, the cflc asks that students follow these general guidelines for writing appointments: come to the center with a plan for your session. set realistic expectations for the amount of material you can cover in a 50 minute session. it is not beneficial to attend a writing appointment the day your paper is due. writing involves revision and time to reflect upon what you and your tutor discussed during your session. please book appointments in advance so that you will have adequate time to revise your paper before it is due. decide whether you need help with the content of your paper or help with the writing process. writing tutors are a great help during the writing process, but they cannot be expected to know content in specific subject areas. if you are having trouble with the content aspect of your paper, please consider seeing a subject tutor instead. a writing appointment is not a \u201cpaper editing\u201d service. writing tutors are here to help with structure, content, and flow of papers; they are not here to proofread for grammar mistakes. writing tutors are not professors, hence they cannot predict the grades of your paper. please do not ask your tutor \u201cwhat grade would you give this paper.\u201d furthermore, seeing a writing tutor does not guarantee your paper will receive a high grade. all papers must be printed out before your session. papers cannot be printed out in the clfc. please bring one copy for yourself and one copy for your tutor to look over. please note: writing tutors cannot provide criticism for take-home midterms and/or final exams without the written consent of the professor saying that it is acceptable to do so. furthermore, tutors are not permitted to provide criticism for dissertations. for questions about dissertations or other longer works, please contact cflc director, dr. sue barrett at barretsc@bc.edu . remember: the goal of a writing appointment is to help create better writers, not just better papers. esl writing appointments vs. other writing appointments writing appointments are meant to help during any stage of the writing process. writing tutors can help students formulate their ideas and also help with the structure and flow of papers. however, a writing appointment is not a paper editing service. writing tutors will not check or proofread papers for grammar mistakes. however, if english is not a student\u2019s first language, the connors family learning center does provide esl writing help. these appointments focus on correcting english grammar mistakes and improving english composition. writing appointments and esl writing appointments are not interchangeable. if english is not your first language and you would like your paper to be checked for english grammar mistakes, please book your appointment with an esl-designated writing tutor. the cflc also offers esl conversation appointments to students who want to improve their english conversation skills. please note that all esl appointments (both esl conversation and esl writing) are limited to 3 appointments per week. updated: december 10, 2013 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston

2007-2008 > year five 2008-2009 > year six 2009-2010 many faculty members, from all disciplines, would like to focus more attention on student writing in their courses. a writing fellows program pairs interested faculty with students who are trained to respond to writing and to work with students. in a \u201cfellowed\u201d course, the faculty member assigns a sequence of typically three papers spread throughout the semester, with scheduled due dates for drafts and final versions. students must hand in drafts of their papers and meet individually with their writing fellow, who offers feedback for revision before the final due date. when students hand in their final version, they also include the earlier drafts and comments from the writing fellow. throughout the year, the writing fellows attend a weekly seminar during which time they receive training in responding to student writing and the rhetorical expectations of the specific discipline; they also meet periodically with the partnering faculty to discuss their expectations for the writing assignments as well as questions or concerns arising from the drafts. why a writing fellows program? this initiative responds to a broadly perceived need among administrators, faculty and students to make writing more central to all fields of study in higher education. it allows a greater attention to writing instruction without costly modifications to the curriculum through a writing across the curriculum (wac) or writing in the disciplines (wid) program. history of writing fellows at boston college the idea for the bc writing fellows program began at a meeting of the bc core curriculum committee in 2003. dr. paul gray (sociology) asked how he might better teach writing in a core sociology course of 60 students. dr. paula mathieu (english) briefly described the writing fellows concept as one used at other universities that might work here. dean joseph quinn followed up that meeting by encouraging mathieu to apply for a teaching advising and mentoring (tam) grant to develop a pilot for such a program. 2004-5 , mathieu formed a writing fellows team, in cooperation with the connors family learning center (directed by suzanne barrett), to create a pilot writing fellows program. the pilot focused on partnering with dr. gray\u2019s comparative social change, a core sociology course with 60 students. four writing fellows, incoming english ma students, received training in reading and responding to student writing, sat in on dr. gray\u2019s course, and met regularly with the writing fellows team to discuss better ways to serve the students. the wf team followed up the pilot with visits to two large, successful writing fellows programs, at brown and tufts universities, and assessed the value of the one-course pilot. 2005-6 , supported by a second year of tam funding, a slightly revised writing fellows pilot worked in three new disciplines: history, political science and geology. in the year-two pilot, all \u201cfellowed\u201d courses included at least three writing assignments, sequenced throughout the semester, which allowed for more discussion of writing and revision spread throughout the term. writing fellows no longer sat in on the \u201cfellowed\u201d course, but instead attended a weekly seminar in writing pedagogy, run by mathieu, and dr. suzanne barrett. the cooperating faculty members periodically attended this seminar, during which time they worked with the wf team to improve their assignment handouts and clearly delineate their writing expectations to the fellows. 2006-2007 , the writing fellow initiative received a third year of pilot-level funding from the college of arts and sciences, and partnered with two new courses in the fall: perspectives (a year-long core course) and world music. in the spring, we continued with the perspectives course and partner once again with a geology/geophysics course, to test what a second semester of writing fellows contributes to a faculty member. results and feedback on the program while all of our research is necessarily anecdotal (we cannot know how these same students would have performed without the writing fellows component), our results are strongly positive. in year one, dr. gray reported that he received \u201cmore a and fewer c\u201d papers than in previous semesters of the course. seventy-two percent of the students in the course responded that the program provided a useful resource ; most of the remaining students admitted they did not take full advantage of the resource. in year two, all three participating faculty commented on the higher level of writing in their courses overall, and particularly from students who seriously committed themselves to the program . two of the three also noted that they found the program helped their own process of conceptualizing and designing assignments. in a survey of 80 students who participated in the program, 80% found it to be a useful resource . in year three, the results confirmed and strengthened our earlier findings, especially in the year-long and repeat course. in an end-of-year survey, 92% of students agreed or strongly agreed that the wf conferences improved their finished work. finally, the writing fellows themselves have all commented that the year of working with students on their writing helped prepare them to teach first-year writing the following year. as new graduate students, this intensive year of preparation in writing pedagogy and working with bc students helped create a foundation for successful teaching in year two. the four writing fellows from years one and two received course evaluations higher than most of their peers when they taught fws in year two of graduate study. the future of the writing fellows program in 2007, the college of arts and sciences committed to continue the writing fellows program with funding for 10 writing fellows. this is a solid basis, from which we can work and grow, possibly seeking out partnerships with other colleges or other ways to grow and develop this important resource for writing and writers at boston college. we welcome your feedback or suggestions. please email us paula mathieu at mathiepa@bc.edu , or suzanne barrett at barretsc@bc.edu . updated: july 13, 2011 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top

complete works of voltaire. it includes all of voltaire's literary works. autour du romantisme th\u00e9\u00e2tre du grand si\u00e8cle covers the 17th century and some of the greatest plays of french theater. it contains some eighty plays from that era by corneille, moli\u00e8re, and racine, including corneille\u2019s cinna, racine\u2019s bajazet, and moli\u00e8re\u2019s les femmes savantes. more access to french literature, via a different interface, is provided by basile , which consists of approximately 1,000 french narrative works, including novels, tales and short stories for the years 1120-1989. the teatro espanol del siglo de oro full text database contains more than 800 plays written by 16 dramatists during the sixteenth and seventeenth century in spain. these important dramatic works are either edited by the playwrights themselves or by an editor \"endorsed\" by the playwright. the entire text of each play is included and searchable. classical languages are also represented, though with less sophisticated interfaces. the library of latin texts: clclt can be difficult to use, but its power resides in providing access to latin texts from the beginning of latin literature (livius andronicus, 240 bc) through to the texts of the second vatican council (1962-1965). it covers all the works from the classical period, the most important patristic works, and includes an extensive corpus of medieval latin literature as well as works of recentior latinitas. the texts have been taken from the corpus christianorum series and from other leading editions. the patrologiae

international coverage is reflected by the fact that 56% of all journals are published in europe, middle east and africa. a further 39% of journals covered are published in north and south america and the remaining 5% are published in asia, australia or new zealand. world news connection includes full text news compiled from thousands of non-u.s. media sources, the information covering significant socioeconomic, political, scientific, technical, and environmental issues and events. the information is obtained from full text and summaries and translations of newspaper articles, conference

pilot this fall the academic integrity task force will launch a pilot this fall of the new comprehensive online tutorial aimed at instructing students in the effective and responsible use of research information. this initiative, a collaboration among faculty, the university libraries, and the connors family learning center, intends to broaden the scope of the integrity issue and view it as an object of intellectual inquiry, focus on the pedagogical dimensions of the question of integrity and make academic integrity a central part of the student culture at boston college. as task force member robert stanton stated, \u201cwe want to emphasize the preventative aspect of academic integrity rather than the punitive aspect. if we can institutionalize a discourse of honesty and integrity, we can move the conversation outward from course syllabi and catalog regulations to a shared set of values that all students can participate in.\u201d with the help of a tam (teaching and mentoring) grant, the tutorial was designed and the online framework put into place. the initial stages involved planning for the tutorial by gathering information on similar tutorials from other universities and surveying the boston college faculty (a faculty-wide survey was administered in spring 2005). the faculty who took the survey overwhelmingly supported the creation of a mandatory online tutorial for undergraduate students. some comments from the anonymous survey included: \u201ci very much support what you are doing! the issue of academic integrity is much broader than plagiarism.\u201d \u201ci really think the focus should be on educating students about how to properly acknowledge sources in written work. some students come to bc woefully under prepared in this area and risk serious violations of the bc policy, in many cases due to their own ignorance.\u201d \u201cthe manner in which texts and information (of all sorts, audio, video\u2026) are now accessible on the internet has changed the way scholarship is practiced and has touched patterns of teaching and older notions of \u2018copyright\u2019 deeply.\u201d next, the task force determined the overall size and shape of the project. the tutorial incorporates both videos and photographs to enhance its visual appeal. several faculty on campus volunteered to be captured on video and comment on academic integrity. the task force collaborated with instructional design and eteaching services as well as media technology services to design the tutorial and incorporate the images. the one hour tutorial, the primary goal of which is to help students understand the basic rules, begins with an introduction to academic integrity as a cornerstone of good scholarship. continuing through the tutorial, students will understand the proper way to cite and acknowledge sources with a focus on careful note-taking, paraphrasing and quoting. next, students will address the ethics of collaborative work and research as well as how to plan for research. the use of scholarly resources is explained and highlighted. lastly, the tutorial provides links for future reference. this tutorial strives to give incoming boston college students a very clear idea about what academic integrity is, how it relates to the work they will be doing at boston college, and how, armed with a better understanding of what this integrity means, the more closely they will be entering an exciting intellectual conversation during their time at bc. the tutorial culminates by making a connection to professional life. as john mcdargh, associate professor in the theology department, comments in a video clip, \u201clearning to write and research in ways that honor the codes of academic integrity that you\u2019ll be learning here is not just important for this little world of boston college. these are important skills of integrity and sharing of writing and researching and publishing that are going to follow you out beyond the walls of this university.\u201d margaret cohen head librarian, educational resource center (erc) task force members include: margaret cohen, head librarian, educational resource center (erc), co-chair; ourida

boston college faq's about teaching at boston college faqs about teaching at boston college here are answers to some of the teaching-related questions we hear most frequently. for more information on these topics or for other questions related to teaching, you are welcome to contact sue barrett (barretsc@bc.edu or 552-0835). questions about bc policies is class attendance required? as a matter of policy, students are expected to attend class, but handling the specifics of that are up to you. it\u2019s a good idea to have an attendance policy of your own, but it\u2019s also good to know that the college catalogue explicitly states that attendance is required. if a student has to miss several classes because of illness or other exceptional circumstances, the student or the family should communicate with the appropriate associate dean, who will notify you that the student needs special consideration. absences for religious reasons are also excused. what are the policies on academic integrity? you can find bc\u2019s policy at: www.bc.edu/integrity in addition to defining cheating, plagiarism and collusion, it outlines the roles of community members, including students, deans and faculty, in promoting academic integrity and goes through the procedures to deal with violations. the policy gives faculty responsibility for creating an atmosphere that encourages academic integrity. the policy goes far beyond making sure nobody cheats on exams. specifically, it states that faculty should discuss academic integrity at the beginning of every semester to make sure that students understand the concept in the context of the class. faculty should also provide a written syllabus that clearly outlines course requirements and due dates, if possible, as well as a statement on academic integrity. exams and assignments should be new each semester or, if not, all students should have equal access to old exams. exams and assignments should be carefully designed to minimize the possibility of dishonesty. proctors should be present at exams. faculty must respect students\u2019 intellectual property and confidentiality. finally, grades should be awarded in a manner that is fair to all students. if, in spite of your efforts, students violate academic integrity, it\u2019s important to hold them accountable. your first step is to discuss the suspected violation with the student. if you decide to impose a grade penalty, you are expected to send a letter to the student\u2019s class dean, describing what has occurred. the student will receive formal notification of the charge and have an opportunity to respond. first offenses typically receive only a warning. the case will eventually come before the committee on academic integrity for the student\u2019s school, as described at the web site given above. how are teaching evaluations handled? students fill out course evaluations online. this has several advantages for faculty, including immediate reports as soon as your course is completed. the online survey contains several standard response questions and 4 open-ended ones. faculty can also add up their own customized questions. you can easily access your evaluations through agora. quantitative data from the evaluations are available to all members of the bc community through the agora portal. students are encouraged to use this information when registering for classes. there is also an on-line evaluation system run by the undergraduate student government where interested students can submit comments about teachers. it is quite unofficial and inconsistent in that students at either extreme tend to submit comments\u2014those that loved or hated a class\u2014and the others usually don\u2019t bother. although most faculty do not take these reviews seriously, many students check them before signing up for classes. you may also want to get some feedback on your teaching without waiting for the end of the semester. there are many methods of getting mid-semester feedback, including just asking your students how the class is going for them. this has the advantage of simplicity, but the disadvantage of not allowing them to answer anonymously. one way around this is to invite someone else in to gather information for you. you might have a department colleague visit your class mid-way in the semester and ask the students to write short answers to three questions: what does this teacher do that helps you learn? what does the teacher do that does not help you learn? and what one or two specific things could this teacher do that would help you learn more in this class? your colleague can then type up the answers, to protect anonymity, and give you the feedback. (this is a service provided by the connors family learning center.) questions about supporting students what should i do when i have a student with a disability? bc serves students with many types of disabilities, including learning disabilities, chronic illnesses or vision or hearing impairments, and some of these students may require accommodations in your course. possible accommodations include signers, note takers, adaptive software and alternative testing arrangements. faculty can be very helpful by choosing books and other course materials well ahead of time so that any adaptations can be arranged in time for all students. all of these students are able to complete academic work successfully and they deserve and have a legal right to reasonable accommodations. accommodations for students with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder are coordinated through the connors family learning center. students with other disabilities receive accommodations through the office of disability services. is there support for teaching students for whom english is not the first language? bc has a large number of international students and also some students who come from u.s. backgrounds where english is the second language. when students are having trouble with english, they may sometimes seem to be having trouble mastering course material. this may or may not be the case. they may understand the material perfectly well but have difficulty demonstrating mastery. there is always a question of fairness\u2014should they have extra time to do work? should you try to overlook grammar and style errors and evaluate them only on their knowledge? or do you think that all students should be able to demonstrate mastery of english as well as of your subject matter? there is no policy that will answer the question for you. there are esl courses available to these students, but they may still have difficulty even after taking the courses. you may decide that it would be fair to allow such a student extra time to complete assignments or in-class work. you can encourage him or her to join a study group or to come to your office hours. make sure the student knows that the connors center offers free tutoring in english for foreign students, as well as in specific course materials. if you have questions or concerns regarding international students, contact the office of international students and scholars at 552-8005. what can i do if i have concerns about a student\u2019s academic performance? if a student is doing poorly in your course, it could be for a number of reasons. the student might actually find the subject matter too difficult or have problems outside the classroom. or he or she might really not be working hard enough. you can definitely recommend the free tutoring in the connors family learning center. however, if you are concerned about a student and have not been able to reach the student personally\u2014maybe because he or she has stopped coming to class--it\u2019s a good idea to get in touch with the class dean. the dean can reach out to the student to see if there is a serious problem, such as an illness at home. if you have to give the student a final grade before the situation has been resolved, try to avoid giving \u201cincompletes\u201d; it\u2019s better to give a grade and then change it later if the situation warrants. what am i expected to do for student-athletes? what is ahana? ahana is bc's acronym for african-american, hispanic, asian and native american students. the office of ahana student programs (oasp)has several programs that support ahana students on campus, including counseling, academic advisement, and career counseling. the oasp also offers a summer program, options through education, which prepares 40-50 pre-freshmen to enter bc each year. if you have any questions about ahana, or if you have a student who might benefit from getting in touch with them, call 552-3358. ahana also sponsors the benjamin e. mays mentoring program which pairs faculty and staff with ahana students who want a mentor. becoming a mays mentor is an excellent way to get to know students as well as other faculty around campus. it doesn\u2019t require a huge time commitment but it is very enjoyable. call ines maturana if you are interested (552-4806). questions about campus resources can someone show me how to use the technology in my classroom? media technology services ( http://www.bc.edu/offices/its/support/mts.html who can help me with using technology in my teaching? instructional design and eteaching services (ides) can help with everything from designing great powerpoint presentations to using course management software. the best way to get an idea of their services is to go to their website: ( http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/offices/ides.html ) they offer workshops, consultations and even office visits. how do the libraries support teaching? you can get an overview of library services through their website ( www.bc.edu/libraries/ ). two that are especially useful for teaching are course reserves and classroom visits. consider putting your textbooks on reserve to make them available to all students, including those who may not be able to afford to buy them. on a classroom visit, a librarian will introduce students to resources useful for your specific course. updated: september 10, 2013 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Faq's About Teaching At Boston College", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/help/tutoring/tutoringinfo.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "Boston College Libraries Faculty Newsletter", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2005spring/staff/index.html", "text": "boston college libraries faculty newsletter volume 6 number 2 spring 2005 staff activities sigma theta tau induction in recognition of her service to the connell school of nursing, wanda anderson , nursing/health sciences reference librarian & bibliographer, was inducted into sigma theta tau as a \u201cfriend of nursing\u201d in april of 2005. sigma theta tau international is the international honor society of nursing. alpha chi chapter is located at boston college school of nursing sparc/sparc europe workshop institutional repositories: the next stage in november 2004 bob gerrity, head of systems , and brendan rapple, collection development librarian , made the presentation escholarship@bc: a timely convergence of institutional repository, e-journal initiatives, etds, and other digital publishing projects at the sparc/sparc europe workshop institutional repositories: the next stage held in washington, dc. the aim of the workshop was to promote understanding of strategies critical to implementing and managing the successful long-term growth of institutional repositories. our presentation focused on the history and chronology of the escholarship@bc initiative of the boston college libraries. the goal of this initiative is to maximize research visibility, influence and benefit by encouraging bc authors to archive and distribute online both unpublished work and peer-reviewed publications in an open-access environment. our presentation focused on the four discrete though intertwined projects comprising escholarship@bc : the library-sponsored open-access scholarly electronic journals ( teaching exceptional children plus . . . and the journal of technology, learning, and assessment escholarship@bc . the workshop had 276 registrants from 184 institutions, 15% of the registrants being from outside the usa. for more information about escholarship@bc contact mark caprio ( caprioma@bc.edu ; 617 552-6432). american library association midwinter conference karen mcnulty, digital resources reference librarian presented at the discussion group \"metasearch: what it is, what it could be, and how standards can help us get there\" at the american library association midwinter conference 2005. karen addressed bc users' experiences with metaquest version 2 and how metasearch standards could improve users' experiences with federated searching. electronic resources in communications studies committee ken liss, communication librarian has been named to a new committee of the education & behavioral sciences section of acrl, the electronic resources in communications studies committee. his term begins on july 1, 2005 and ends on june 30, 2007. committee meetings will be held at ala and ala midwinter. annual scientific meeting of the american society of cytopathology wanda anderson, nursing reference librarian/bibliographer attended the annual scientific meeting of the american society of cytopathology in chicago. \"current issues in cytology\" highlighted \"international efforts to fight cancer\" which focused on the multicultural educational programs needed to emphasize the importance of early screening for the detection of cancer. questions, comments?

with the resources provided by the libraries to access the full text of over 7000 plays published in english, french and spanish. these collections or databases also provide other materials such as selected playbills, production photographs, costume sketches, cast lists, playwrights\u2019 notes, and other ephemera related to the plays. the plays were published and produced from as early as the late thirteenth century - the likely date of the shrewsbury fragments - to alice tuan\u2019s coastline written in 2004. they include the earliest printed american play, robert hunter's satire androboros (1714) and the authoritative editions of all of shakespeare\u2019s plays. chadwyck healy (now proquest) and alexander street press, vendors of a large number of the plays, have creatively used technology to aid in scholarly analysis of this particular literary form. for example, you can easily find all the plays written by t.s. eliot or august wilson, or plays which refer to abraham lincoln, or find what plays were first performed in 1859, or a list of plays by hispanic american or irish-american playwrights, or find plays where the word \u201cepidemic\u201d appears, or plays set in dublin. the possibilities for study and analysis are endless. though plays are intended for performing, performance rights must still be secured from the appropriate copyright holders. specific performance rights information is provided, when available. the following are brief overviews of some of the libraries\u2019 major play collections: english drama 1280-1915 (proquest) a unique collection of more than 4000 plays in verse and prose tracing the development of drama in english from the medieval mystery cycles to the comedies of oscar wilde. it offers exhaustive coverage of the prodigious dramatic literature of the elizabethan and jacobean periods, as well as restoration plays, medieval morality plays and mystery cycles. major dramatists such as ben jonson, aphra behn, william wycherley, oliver goldsmith, richard sheridan, oscar wilde and j. m. synge, are well represented. editions and adaptations of shakespeare 1591-1911 (proquest) contains eleven major editions from the first folio of 1623 to the cambridge edition of 1863-6, twenty-eight separate contemporary printings of individual plays and poems, selected apocrypha and related works. in addition, it contains more than one hundred adaptations, sequels and burlesques from the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. american drama 1714-1915 (proquest) contains a comprehensive survey of american drama from the colonial period to the beginning of the twentieth century that chronicles the history and culture of america in verse, farces, melodramas, minstrel shows, realist plays, frontier plays, temperance dialogues and a range of other genres. asian american drama (alexander street press) contains more than 250 plays by over 40 playwrights from the late nineteenth century and includes such contemporary playwrights as philip kan gotanda, elizabeth wong, and jeannie barroga. over half of these plays have never been published before. black drama (alexander street press) contains the full text of approximately 1,200 plays written from the mid-1800s to the present by more than 150 playwrights from north america, english-speaking africa, the caribbean, and other african diaspora countries. many of the works are rare, hard to find, or out of print. the collection includes previously unpublished plays by writers such as langston hughes, ed bullins, willis richardson, amiri baraka, randolph edmonds, and zora neale hurston. north american theatre online (alexander street press) is a comprehensive reference work covering all aspects of the canadian and american theatre from the 1600s to the present. it contains detailed records for more than 10,000 plays, over 40,000 full text records for people, places, theatres, productions, production companies, and over 5,000 images of playbills, postcards, scrapbooks and other resources. further links to thousands of editorially selected items on the web are also provided. it can also be used to cross search other alexander street press databases. teatro espa\u00f1ol del siglo de oro (proquest) contains the full text of the most important dramatic works of sixteenth and seventeenth century spain with over 800 plays written by 16 dramatists including lope de vega, calder\u00f3n de la barca, agust\u00edn moreto etc. the entire text of each play is provided in both english and spanish. th\u00e9\u00e2tre du

university administrators, faculty, and librarians from many nations met in budapest under the auspices of george soros's open society institute and established the framework of the budapest open access initiative (boai) which has the goal of making research articles in all academic fields freely available on the internet. boai -- boston college libraries is a signatory -- has clear expectations: more universities creating institutional digital archives and encouraging faculty to make reprints and refereed articles freely accessible through them; many new journals in every field committed to open access; young entrants to the academy thinking open access as normal; taxpayers demanding open access to government funded research; more and more beneficiaries of research, for example medical patients, demanding the removal of gratuitous obstacles to research so that the knowledge freely bestowed by their creators will be freely available to researchers everywhere. this principle of open access advocated by the budapest initiative is not new. the call for ready and free access to all scholarship for everyone has been voiced for a long time. however, more recent are the electronic means to make such access a reality, with digital repositories being one of the paramount means. an important participant in this call for open access has been the alliance for taxpayer access (ata). ata, a coalition of libraries and library organizations (boston college libraries is a member), patient and health policy advocates, and other stakeholders, has for some time been advocating free online access to national institutes of health (nih) funded, that is taxpayer funded, research. in may 2005, after much deliberation, the terms of the final nih public access policy implementation were agreed upon. researchers funded by the nih are requested to submit to the nih manuscript submission system (nihms) at pubmed central (pmc) their final manuscript resulting from research supported in whole or in part with direct costs from nih. the \u201cfinal manuscript\u201d is defined as the final version accepted for journal publication, and including all modifications from the peer review process. pubmed central, run by the nih's national library of medicine, is a digital, open access, permanent, and searchable repository of full-text, peer-reviewed biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research journals. the nih strongly encourages all nih-funded investigators to deposit their final manuscripts in pubmed central, immediately after journal publication thereby making them readily available to other researchers and the public. however, \u201cauthors are given the option to release their manuscripts at a later time, up to 12 months after the official date of final publication. nih expects that only in limited cases will authors deem it necessary to select the longest delay period\" ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-05-045.html ) it is expected that several important benefits will result from this new nih policy. first, it will constitute the creation of a stable and permanent archive of peer-reviewed publications resulting from nih-funded research. second, it will greatly facilitate making publications resulting from nih funded research more easily accessible to health care providers, scientists, educators, the public, indeed anyone with internet access. third, it will create \u201ca searchable compendium of these peer-reviewed research publications that the nih and its awardees can use to manage more efficiently and to understand better their research portfolios, monitor scientific productivity, and ultimately, help set research priorities.\u201d heather joseph, executive director of sparc (the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition), recently stated that the alliance for taxpayer access holds that the success of this new nih policy will be measured by the number of articles deposited in pubmed central and how soon after publication they are made accessible to the public. this seems reasonable and appropriate. an assessment by congress of the policy is planned for early 2006: \"to assist the congress in assessing the degree of success of this new policy, the committee requests a progress report by no later than february 1, 2006. specifically, the committee requests that the report contain the following information: (1) the total number of peer-reviewed articles deposited in pubmed central since the may 2, 2005 implementation date and the distribution of chosen delay periods; (2) an assessment of the extent to which the implemented policy has led to improved public access; (3) an assessment of the impact of the policy on the peer review system; and (4) the cost of operating the database.\" ( senate report 109-103 ) however, it is unfortunate that so far the proportion of manuscripts deposited has not been as great as hoped for by the ata or by the nih. accordingly, i t is essential that this proportion increases in the coming months to be taken into account by congress\u2019s assessment and, as important, to be made freely available to anyone with internet access. bc libraries, strongly committed to and supportive of open access to scholarly literature, encourage bc authors whose research has been funded by the nih to deposit their resulting research publications in pubmed central as soon as possible. brendan rapple collection development questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . subscribe to the boston

disabilities: 1) curriculum . the undergraduate curriculum at boston college is very demanding. all students must complete 15 core courses -- including mathematics, natural sciences, history, philosophy, and theology -- that require numerous reading and writing assignments. class sizes in core and introductory courses range from fifteen to more than three hundred students. major courses in all departments are intensive. consequently, each applicant is evaluated in terms of his/her ability to succeed in boston college's challenging academic programs. we do not have a separate ld program, but rather services and accommodations to assist students in our regular curriculum. 2) documentation . the admissions office requests that you voluntarily submit documentation of learning disabilities with your application . diagnostic reports submitted should be from evaluations done no more than three years prior to the time of application. these reports should outline the nature of the disability, specific cognitive deficits, and achievement levels. reports should also include a description of specific academic support services used in high school and academic accommodations that will be needed in college. a statement regarding specific guidelines for documentation can be found below. 3) admissions . the admissions office evaluates all applications and makes all decisions. the committee on learning disabilities -- composed of knowledgeable faculty and professional staff --assists the admissions office in evaluating the credentials of applicants who voluntarily present documentation of learning disabilities. guidelines for documentation of a specific learning disability: students who are seeking support services from boston college on the basis of a diagnosed specific learning disability are required to submit documentation to verify eligibility under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the americans with disabilities act of 1990. the following guidelines are provided to ensure that documentation is appropriate to verify eligibility and support requests for reasonable accommodations. 1. testing must be current specifically this means that the testing must be conducted within the last four years. because the provision of all reasonable accomodations and services is based upon assessment of the current impact of the student's disabilites on his/her academic performance, it is in the student's best interest to provide recent and appropriate documentation. 2. testing must be comprehensive testing must reflect the student's present levels of aptitude, achievement and information processing. tests used must be technically sound (i.e. statistically reliable and valid) and standardized for use with an adult population. actual test scores must be provided. standard scores and/or percentiles are acceptable. it is not acceptable to administer only one test for the purpose of diagnosis. 3. qualifications of evaluator trained and certified learning disability specialists and/or licensed psychologists may conduct the assessment. diagnostic reports must include the names, title, and professional credentials of the evaluators, as well as the date(s) of the testing. 4. specific ld must be diagnosed there must be clear and specific evidence of a learning disability. \"individual learning styles\" and \"learning differences\" in and of themselves do not constitute a learning disability. 5. educational recommendations educational recommendations regarding the impact of the disability and accommodations recommended at the post-secondary level must be included. guidelines for documentation of attention deficit disorder: documentation must provide information regarding the onset, longevity, and severity of the symptoms, as well as the specifics of describing how it has interfered with educational achievement. it must include an in-depth evaluation from the psychiatrist/psychologist/physician who made the diagnosis, as well as specific educational recommendations. information regarding suggested pharmacological interventions should be made as well.

alternative to the web of science database. introduced to the market in late 2004, scopus is still undergoing development, but already has attracted attention for its expansive journal coverage and

2005 creative commons and science commons the legal troubles of grokster and google print have made headline news of complex questions of copyright and digital duplication. while readers and listeners have rejoiced at the unprecedented availability of content online, many content producers have panicked at the prospect of copyright infringement on a massive scale, enabled by the technological ease of making and exchanging copies. book publishers and the entertainment industries have reacted by lobbying for legal restrictions on companies that facilitate or undertake duplication of copyrighted materials. perhaps this is understandable\ufffdnew technologies that encourage the flouting of copyright law mean lost revenue, or so the reasoning goes. but some observers argue that these industries seek excessive control that will undermine innovation and expression, as well as endangering potentially lucrative means of promotion and delivery. rather than worry that new technologies jeopardize the protections of copyright, some scientists and scholars are concerned about the reverse: they fear that intellectual property restrictions are needlessly impeding the free flow of ideas and information encouraged by the internet. science commons , a project of the organization creative commons based at m.i.t., was established earlier this year to address these concerns. science commons works for intellectual property reform in three areas of scientific research: publishing, licensing, and data. creative commons was founded in 2001 to find solutions that protect authors' rights while still offering the possibility of unfettered distribution, duplication, and derivation. creative commons has developed a set of licenses that authors can adopt to ease restrictions on others' use of their work. the licenses give copyright holders options for permitting or restricting commercial use of their work and the creation of derivative works, and, if derivative works are allowed, for mandating that derivative works use the same creative commons licensing terms. all other uses of the work are permitted by the licenses. the science commons publishing project builds on the work of creative commons, advocating the removal of legal barriers to the circulation of scholarship under the principles of open access. some open-access publishers, including public library of science and biomedcentral, have adopted the creative commons attribution license, which lets readers download, reuse, reprint, distribute, or copy articles as long as the original author and source are credited. science commons recently launched the open access law program, which aims to make legal scholarship available without undue copyright restrictions and without cost to readers. under the program, science commons has drafted open access law journal principles and an open access law author pledge that let journals and scholars commit publicly to the ideals of open access. thirty legal journals worldwide have currently adopted or have policies consistent with the principles. science commons has also created the open access model publishing agreement, which is available online as a ready means for authors and journals to implement creative commons licenses in their work. in addition to the current concern of restricted access to scholarly and scientific publications, the end product of research, science commons is also focusing on emerging concerns about copyright restrictions to scientific data, the raw material of research. the longstanding tradition of the exemption of facts from copyright protection under u.s. intellectual property law faces an uncertain future. the eu in 1996 enacted a database directive that grants factual databases copyright protection, and some fear that a similar measure looms in the united states ' future. apart from legal restrictions, database providers in the u.s. have created de facto copyright protections for factual data by producing databases that combine copyrighted material with factual data in a way that makes it difficult to deal separately with the factual data, both legally and as a practical matter of access. in addition, more restrictive approaches to managing and sharing data are emerging in the scientific community, with some scientists wary of losing control of data and some subject to limiting institutional requirements. science commons is planning to document these issues and to develop legal solutions for databases using the same \ufffdsome rights reserved\ufffd philosophy of creative commons. michelle

engaged in a review of our largest electronic journal package, sciencedirect . belying its name, the package contains journals in a wide range of disciplines, and many academic departments have been contacted to rank the importance of individual titles to their research and teaching. last spring we initiated a project to reduce the duplication of print and electronic resources, and sciencedirect was one of the packages reviewed. as a result of that process, the decision was made to go e-only for several hundred journals. now we are focused on the content and usage of the package rather than on the format. faculty input is critical to the success of this project, which will have long-term impact on the management of the library materials budget. known in the library field as the \u201cbig deal\u201d, sciencedirect is an elsevier e-journal platform which is available through library consortia. a number of research library consortia are currently subscribing to the \u201cbig deal,\u201d but there have been defections in recent years by several major research libraries. the package offers more favorable terms than an individual library subscription by limiting price increases over the life of the package and providing an option to purchase online access to all of the elsevier e-journals subscribed to by consortia members. packages are available for one, three, or five year commitments. the advantages of the multi-year packages are many, but they come at a steep price: loss of control of our own content and budget. cancellations are prohibited; titles may be \u201cswapped\u201d within the package offerings, as long as the same dollar subscription base is maintained. this effectively means that elsevier journals cannot be cancelled to free up funds for new non-elsevier titles. multi-year deals are the best value if access to the full suite of sciencedirect titles is crucial. the one year option has much less favorable terms (higher content fees and price caps) than the multi-year options and, as a result, is more costly to support access to the identical content. the benefit of a one year option is the potential for flexibility, not being locked in for three or five years. boston college has participated in sciencedirect via the boston library consortium for six years by signing up twice for three year deals. the contract is currently up for renewal for the 2006-2008 subscription years. costs for science direct are significant, one sixth of the total library materials budget. is it worth it? your feedback on the title lists prepared by

published in english, french and spanish. these collections or databases also provide other materials such as selected playbills, production photographs, costume sketches, cast lists, playwrights\u2019 notes, and other ephemera related to the plays. the plays were published and produced from as early as the late thirteenth century - the likely date of the shrewsbury fragments - to alice tuan\u2019s coastline written in 2004. they include the earliest printed american play, robert hunter's satire androboros (1714) and the authoritative editions of all of shakespeare\u2019s plays. chadwyck healy (now proquest) and alexander street press, vendors of a large number of the plays, have creatively used technology to aid in scholarly analysis of this particular literary form. for example, you can easily find all the plays written by t.s. eliot or august wilson, or plays which refer to abraham lincoln, or find what plays were first performed in 1859, or a list of plays by hispanic american or irish-american playwrights, or find plays where the word \u201cepidemic\u201d appears, or plays set in dublin. the possibilities for study and analysis are endless. though plays are intended for performing, performance rights must still be secured from the appropriate copyright holders. specific performance rights information is provided, when available. the following are brief overviews of some of the libraries\u2019 major play collections: english drama 1280-1915 (proquest) a unique collection of more than 4000 plays in verse and prose tracing the development of drama in english from the medieval mystery cycles to the comedies of oscar wilde. it offers exhaustive coverage of the prodigious dramatic literature of the elizabethan and jacobean periods, as well as restoration plays, medieval morality plays and mystery cycles. major dramatists such as ben jonson, aphra behn, william wycherley, oliver goldsmith, richard sheridan, oscar wilde and j. m. synge, are well represented. editions and adaptations of shakespeare 1591-1911 (proquest) contains eleven major editions from the first folio of 1623 to the cambridge edition of 1863-6, twenty-eight separate contemporary printings of individual plays and poems, selected apocrypha and related works. in addition, it contains more than one hundred adaptations, sequels and burlesques from the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. american drama 1714-1915 (proquest) contains a comprehensive survey of american drama from the colonial period to the beginning of the twentieth century that chronicles the history and culture of america in verse, farces, melodramas, minstrel shows, realist plays, frontier plays, temperance dialogues and a range of other genres. asian american drama (alexander street press) contains more than 250 plays by over 40 playwrights from the late nineteenth century and includes such contemporary playwrights as philip kan gotanda, elizabeth wong, and jeannie barroga. over half of these plays have never been published before. black drama (alexander street press) contains the full text of approximately 1,200 plays written from the mid-1800s to the present by more than 150 playwrights from north america, english-speaking africa, the caribbean, and other african diaspora countries. many of the works are rare, hard to find, or out of print. the collection includes previously unpublished plays by writers such as langston hughes, ed bullins, willis richardson, amiri baraka, randolph edmonds, and zora neale hurston. north american theatre online (alexander street press) is a comprehensive reference work covering all aspects of the canadian and american theatre from the 1600s to the present. it contains detailed records for more than 10,000 plays, over 40,000 full text records for people, places, theatres, productions, production companies, and over 5,000 images of playbills, postcards, scrapbooks and other resources. further links to thousands of editorially selected items on the web are also provided. it can also be used to cross search other alexander street press databases. teatro espa\u00f1ol del siglo de oro (proquest) contains the full text of the most important dramatic works of sixteenth and seventeenth century spain with over 800 plays written by 16 dramatists including lope de vega, calder\u00f3n de

tapestries, oriental rugs, statues and oil paintings in virtually every room. at one point 138 paintings from as early as the 14th century were displayed in bapst. all of these artworks now belong to the mcmullen museum of art at boston college, and are put on display periodically. currently, objects from the mcmullen museum\u0092s collection are on display throughout the bapst art library.

1 fall 2004 escholarship@bc a digital institutional repository for boston college the boston college libraries have joined a growing community of academic libraries that are building open-access, web-accessible repositories designed to collect, organize, preserve, and provide easy access to the scholarly material produced by members of the boston college community. the new \"institutional repository,\" escholarship@bc , publishes both textual materials--preprints, postprints, working papers, conference proceedings, etc.-- and non-print material, such as streamed audio and video files, data sets, and multimedia presentations. escholarship@bc also includes digital versions of boston college theses and dissertations, plus several new electronic journals. background the concept of an \"institutional repository\" (ir) garnered widespread notice with the 2002 publication of a position paper by raym crow of the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition (sparc), an affiliate of the association of research libraries (arl), of which boston college is a member. crow makes a compelling case that institutional repositories, building on the principles and successes of existing disciplinary repositories such as repec (for economics) and arxiv (for physics), can help reform the system of scholarly communication by broadening access to research, reasserting the academy's control over scholarship by the academy, reducing the monopoly power of commercial journals, and bringing economic relief and heightened relevance to the institutions and libraries that support irs. furthermore, crow posits, institutional repositories \"can serve as tangible indicators of a university's quality, thus increasing its visibility, prestige, and public value.\" library support for open access another cornerstone of the escholarship@bc initiative is the boston college libraries' support for the principle of open access to scholarly information. the libraries are a signatory of the budapest open access initiative , which promotes the free availability of scholarly literature on the internet, \"without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.\" in addition to benefiting consumers of scholarly information, open access benefits scholars as well, increasing the visibility, influence, and potential benefit of their research. it helps redress global inequity of access to scholarship by dismantling cost barriers to research dissemination. and it returns research results more swiftly and readily to the public, who provide much of the funding for scholarly work. all of the material that is archived in escholarship@bc is available on an open-access basis. the repository also includes links to boston college dissertations published and hosted by proquest, and the full text of these is restricted to boston college faculty, students, and staff, although abstracts and 24-page previews are available to all users. the libraries are pursuing options to ensure that future boston college dissertations are available on an open-access basis. technology the technology platform for escholarship@bc is a publishing system called digital commons, developed by berkeley electronic press (bepress) and marketed by proquest. key features of digital commons include support for web-based author submissions, streamlined peer-review processes, flexible publication options, and full-text indexing of published textual materials. the system also conforms to the open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting (oai-pmh), meaning that descriptive information about materials published in the repository are accessible to major search engines such as google and yahoo, ensuring maximum exposure. site structure and current content the escholarship@bc site is organized around three major components: the main repository, organized by academic department, research center, or other campus unit, and the two associated e-publishing initiatives the libraries are sponsoring: e-journals, and theses and dissertations. in the main repository, current content includes selected working papers from the economics department and the center for retirement research, newly digitized occasional papers by boston college's first university historian, rev. charles f. donovan, s.j., and the occasional papers produced by the church in the 21st century project. the e-journals section includes a recently launched journal, teaching exceptional children plus, co-edited by alec peck of the lynch school. also included is the journal of technology, learning and assessment, edited by the lynch school\u0092s mike russell, which was migrated from a homegrown e-publishing system to the bepress platform. implementation plan escholarship@bc currently is in limited production, with content from selected academic departments, research centers, and other campus units. the bc libraries will work with these existing repository communities over the 2004/2005 academic year to identify and add additional content, streamline the submission and publication workflows, and begin to develop policies and procedures for a full campus rollout for the 2005/2006 academic year. an advisory board that will include faculty and administrators is being formed to set policies for the content, operation, and growth of escholarship@bc . questions? for more information about the escholarship@bc project, contact bob gerrity ( gerrityr@bc.edu ) or brendan rapple ( rappleb@bc.edu ). questions,

have had a dramatic effect on the collections policies and budgets of academic libraries. historically at boston college, budgets were allocated by specific subject areas, and split between monographic funds and serial subscriptions. for many years, the traditional balance held at 40% monographs, 60% serials. with the explosion of electronic resources, the balance began to shift. purchases of electronic resources were made primarily from monographic allocations, with the result that in the past year, serials accounted for 52%, electronic resources for 30%, and monographs for 18%. projecting those figures lead to a grim prognosis; without a plan, monographic purchases will continue to decline, and the budget will be consumed by subscription and access fees for serials and electronic resources. another factor with major impact on the budget is the skyrocketing cost of serials, particularly in the sciences. the university has generously given the library materials budget an annual increase of about 4%; even in years when many libraries experienced significant cuts to the budget, we received this increase. unfortunately, in the area of serials, the increases in our costs range from 6%-15%; we've been losing purchasing power for close to a decade. two years ago the library completed a small project to cancel periodicals, resulting in a 5% budget relief. at this point, we need to look for a more strategic approach to collection management, or to undertake a major cancellation project just to balance expenditures. identifying ways to free up funds for new resources is also crucial. over the past year we have begun approaching collection management more strategically by implementing a formal review process for all electronic resources. there is an expectation that this process may enable us to eliminate some resources, and to make better choices among electronic resources we offer. we are in the process of identifying a task force of subject specialists to lead a collection management initiative. this group, working in collaboration with all subject specialists, will identify strategies for the reduction of print resources, especially periodicals, in favor of electronic, for the reduction of duplication among resources, for increasing monographic purchasing, and they will investigate broader based approaches to electronic resource budget allocations. the task force will seek to secure as much faculty input as possible in drawing up these strategies. the collections and resources of bc libraries have expanded dramatically over the past decade. complementing the print volumes that now number over two million and the increasingly strong collections in serials, government documents, media, and microforms are the numerous excellent digital resources that support research and the curriculum. however, we have now reached a pivotal point in resource management. we must carefully define and articulate our future collection management vision for the boston college libraries, and ensure that we remain attuned to the needs of the curriculum and the faculty research we support. christine conroy associate university

including peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, preprints, abstracts and technical reports from all broad areas of research.\u0094 what will be the impact of google scholar on students' research

scholar and submit your thoughts to the bc libraries . google and other search engines have opened access to a wealth of information unimaginable just a few years ago. but do your students know when and how to do more than simple \"googling?\" do they engage in \"conversation\" with scholars and their ideas as found in books, journals, and, yes, on the web? as part of an effort to enhance the library research instructional program, the bc libraries recently surveyed faculty in several departments to get their perspective on the quality of students' research in the internet age. the survey was part of the libraries' ongoing effort to understand and improve students' \"information competency\" through instruction, individual consultations, and collaboration with faculty. here is some of what we heard. \"some students seem to think google is the only place to go,\" said a faculty member from the english department. \"mla and other databases (not to mention good old-fashioned bound books in actual stacks in an actual bricks and mortar building) sometimes don't seem to cross their radar screens without a bit of prompting.\" a psychology faculty member stated \"sadly, i suspect that many are just 'lazy' about doing the investigative work that goes into a research project. it would be useful to stress to students that this 'hard investigative work' is part of the research process, so that they know that they should perhaps be investigating more than they often do.\" \"students certainly find google seductive,\" said a first year writing seminar instructor. \"i think one way to move beyond it is to engage with it directly. in other words, show them how a search engine works and the kinds of the things you can expect to get from it (or can't). then move beyond it to other databases, books, and other resources.\" several faculty members said the problem is not just where students search, but how they search and what they do with the results. \"as we all know, there's a huge divide between information, and what constitutes actual research vis-\u00e0-vis a problem being solved,\" said a carroll school of management faculty member. \"with the ease of access that the internet has provided, unfortunately, an increasing subset of students occasionally looks to research as more of a check-off-the-box exercise.\" \"they have the ability to find research or data-based articles but the quality of their papers are often poor from the perspective of being able to synthesize the information,\" commented a nursing faculty member. \"there is a tendency to just list what they find rather than thinking through what they find and presenting cogent arguments or positions.\" in an effort to expand the benefits of library research instruction, the bc libraries are working to implement standard based instructional programs defined in part by the association of college and research libraries information literacy competency standards for higher education . \"at the undergraduate level, i think they often need guidance navigating what is, by anyone's standards, an incredibly complex web of information,\" added an english professor. \"this help needs to come at every level, from how to find good information, to how to cite internet sources, etc. with that guidance, they do quite well in my experience; the end results are, by and large, strong examples of responsible research.\" librarians are available to partner with faculty in the effort to guide and educate students to critically evaluate their information needs and develop effective research strategies. for more information on working with bc librarians on improving student research, contact your library subject specialist . questions, comments? contact the bc libraries

apprenticeship in college teaching program. the program coordinates and formalizes efforts that have long been under way in departments and in the university to prepare graduate students for teaching at boston college and in their future careers. by combining these efforts, the apprenticeship program provides graduate students with a framework within which they can deliberately plan their development as teaching scholars. students who complete the program will receive a letter from the office of the provost for inclusion in their teaching portfolios. students who choose to participate will file a plan of completion, including their goals and a proposed timeline, with the connors family learning center. since students\u2019 plans will differ depending on their departments, each department will have a liaison to help students choose the best ways to complete the program requirements, either through departmental or university resources. the program is very flexible and can be completed in one year or over the course of two or even three years. required components: submit an online plan for completion to the cflc. attend a teaching orientation, to be held at the beginning of each semester. write a course syllabus. conduct and write up a teaching observation of a faculty member. invite a faculty member to conduct and write up an observation of you teaching, in person and/or on videotape. document your completion of all components in a teaching portfolio that includes a reflective statement of your teaching philosophy. all participants have the option of creating an electronic portfolio. benefits: practical advice and information about college teaching, learning, college students and academic careers one-on-one guidance from faculty and the cflc in developing your teaching skills. a credential to demonstrate your commitment to teaching. help in developing an online portfolio, a very useful tool in the job search. many more details will be available by the

family learning center > executive summary apprenticeship in collegeteaching apprenticeship in college teaching: a certificate program for graduate students executive summary boston college does a good job of preparing graduate students for their roles as teachers at bc and beyond. by taking advantage of departmental and university resources, students can, for example, attend workshops on preparing a syllabus, leading discussions, grading fairly, teaching with technology and creating a teaching portfolio. they can also observe faculty teaching, take departmental courses and work with teaching mentors. until now, however, bc has not offered a university-wide incentive to encourage and reward participation in these programs. many of bc\u2019s peer institutions, including brown, georgetown, notre dame and the university of virginia, award certificates to students who complete a preparation program for college teaching. starting in 2011-2012, bc graduate students, too, will be able to earn a certificate and a letter from the office of the provost. participants will also leave the program with a completed teaching portfolio that will help them in their own development and in their job searches. apprenticeship in college teaching graduate students are usually very excited when they receive their first appointment as a teaching assistant or fellow. they are eager for the new responsibility and the chance to share their subject with other students. they want to do well and live up to the expectations of their departments, but they may also be worried. they wonder if their students will see them as \u2018\u2019real\u201d teachers and if they themselves will feel confident at the head of the classroom. they also worry that teaching will take too much time away from their other academic duties. at the same time, parents of prospective students often express concern about their children being taught by graduate students. in fact, many first-year students do have at least one teaching fellow or teaching assistant, and frequently they have several. graduate students have much to offer undergraduates\u2014enthusiasm, fresh perspectives on their fields and new ideas about teaching\u2014but they are apprentices. they need and deserve assistance in becoming the excellent teachers our undergraduates are hoping to encounter in college. the apprenticeship in college teaching program is designed to help ta/tfs become the best teachers possible. boston college already does a good job of preparing tas and tfs. most of the preparation takes place in departments, through formal programs and mentoring relationships. the connors family learning center (clcf) also offers a series of workshops and consultation services. the new apprenticeship program will build on and work with these efforts to provide our students with truly outstanding preparation. graduate students who decide to complete the program will demonstrate their commitment to their students and to their own futures as academics. through seminars and workshops, they will become familiar with useful teaching techniques and develop confidence in their abilities as teachers. through meetings with faculty in their departments and careful teaching observations, they will become knowledgeable about teaching in their disciplines. by developing a syllabus and a teaching portfolio, they will become reflective and intentional teachers, able to discuss their teaching philosophy and techniques with prospective employers. at the end of the program, students will earn a certificate to help them compete for teaching jobs after graduation. the credential will show their commitment to teaching and help them stand out from other applicants. they can also expect to have better student evaluations at the end of each semester, which will make them even more attractive as they enter the job market. the apprenticeship program will offer a new and exciting opportunity for bc graduate students. it will also underline bc\u2019s commitment to developing our graduate students\u2014the next generation of faculty members\u2014and to providing excellent teaching to the students they will be teaching at bc and beyond. overview of requirements all graduate students are invited to participate in bc\u2019s new apprenticeship in college teaching program. the program coordinates and formalizes efforts that have long been under way in departments and in the university to prepare graduate students for teaching at boston college and in their future careers. by combining these efforts, the apprenticeship program provides graduate students with a framework within which they can deliberately plan their development as teaching scholars. students who complete the program will receive a letter from the office of the provost for inclusion in their teaching portfolios. students who choose to participate will file a plan of completion, including their goals and a proposed timeline, with the connors family learning center. since students\u2019 plans will differ depending on their departments, each department will have a liaison to help students choose the best ways to complete the program requirements, either through departmental or university resources. the program is very flexible and can be completed in one year or over the course of two or even three years. required components: submit an online plan for completion to the cflc. attend a teaching orientation, to be held at the beginning of each semester. write a course syllabus. conduct and write up a teaching observation of a faculty member. invite a faculty member to conduct and write up an observation of you teaching, in person and/or on videotape. document your completion of all components in a teaching portfolio that includes a reflective statement of your teaching philosophy. all participants have the option of creating an electronic portfolio. benefits: practical advice and information about college teaching, learning, college students and academic careers one-on-one guidance from faculty and the cflc in developing your teaching skills. a credential to demonstrate your commitment to teaching. help in developing an online portfolio, a very useful tool in the job search. components of the apprentice program plan for completion students will submit an online form that asks them to consider their reasons for wanting to earn the certificate; this is the beginning of the reflective approach to their own teaching. the form will also ask for their plan of completion, including a timeline and an indication of how they plan to complete the requirements (i.e., through departmental or cflc workshops). workshops students will begin with an orientation, at the beginning of either fall or spring semester, that covers immediate concerns of classroom management, use of technology at bc, what to do on the first day of class, etc. write a course syllabus. students will write their own syllabus for a course that they will be teaching at bc or, if they never have to write their own syllabus, for a possible future course after graduation. the workshop will prepare them and they will get feedback from the cflc and/or department faculty. conduct and write up a teaching observation of a faculty member. after attending a workshop on what to look for in a teaching observation, students will choose a faculty member, in consultation with their departmental liaison, and ask permission to observe. they will be looking for methods that they can emulate or avoid in their own teaching. invite a faculty member to conduct and write up an observation of you teaching, in person and/or on videotape. all students should be observed teaching, even if this has to be a mock lesson for those not yet in the classroom. it may be a faculty member from the student\u2019s department who performs the observation but if this is not possible, the apprenticeship program directors can arrange to do it. teaching portfolio students will document their completion of all components in a teaching portfolio that includes a reflective statement of their teaching philosophy. all participants have the option of creating an electronic portfolio. the apprenticeship program directors will look carefully at the portfolios and meet with each student individually. the portfolio is the capstone of the program. this is where students bring together their experiences and reflect on their beliefs about teaching, their own style and methods. the portfolio should be much more than a collection of items about teaching. it should be an organized overview of the teacher, with a beginning, middle and end. it usually contains: a title page, a table of contents, a cv, an overview of the teaching history, a statement of teaching philosophy, sample syllabi, examples of class activities, student work and evaluations. online versions can also include video. some also include reflective statements on how the teacher hopes to improve. for our certificate program, candidates will include a section on how they have developed as teachers, including the workshops they attended and their reflections on them and the observations they did and that were done of them. there will also be an official certificate stating that they have completed the program. appendix i sample

sessions iii teaching in the disciplines, sessions led by faculty appendix ii descriptions of sessions offered by the cflc designing a syllabus in this interactive workshop, participants will go through the steps of planning a syllabus. the first step is articulating your goals for the course: what do you want your students to achieve? what should they be able to do by the end of the class? next you\u2019ll plan out how they will reach these goals\u2014what will they read, do, write? how much can you reasonably expect them to do for each class? finally, what observable behaviors (tests, papers, projects) will let you know that you and your students have achieved the course goals? how will you evaluate and grade them? in this interactive session, students will articulate their goals and begin work on the steps to achieving them. we will also go over important components such as policies on attendance, late papers, accommodations for disabilities and academic integrity. we will have a syllabus checklist. grading fairly grades can be a powerful tool in teaching, but students must feel that they are being graded fairly. in this seminar, we will explore ways to make sure that you are very clear in your expectations and about the ways you will be grading. what are your criteria for an assignment? what will an a look like? and a b? will you grade on a curve? do you accept extra credit? what is the average grade at bc? and in your department? we will go over some basics of grading and then discuss cases that touch on difficult areas in grading. creating a teaching portfolio a portfolio is the showcase of your teaching development. it is your opportunity to show the world what happens in your classroom. your students leave at the end of each semester\u2014what will you have left to show prospective employers? a teaching portfolio is the place to collect artifacts of your teaching and to demonstrate your philosophy and approach to your discipline. this workshop will introduce the important elements of a teaching portfolio, using examples of hard-copy and online portfolios. the second half of the workshop will help you get started on your teaching philosophy statement, the heart of any portfolio. managing your classroom no matter what your discipline, managing students is a part of teaching. this session will cover all sorts of practical questions, such as what to do about laptops in class, late arrivals, students who have special needs or situations and students who have to miss class because of athletic schedules or other outside obligations. we will also discuss difficult conversations that can arise around race or sexual orientation or in response to situations that occur on campus or in the world. observing and being observed in addition to these five required workshops, students will choose at least two others: leading discussions, running a lab, lecturing, discussion with a master teacher, developing rubrics, understanding learning styles and teaching inclusively. apprenticeship in college teaching checklist for certificate submit an online plan for completion, with guidance from a department faculty

interlibrary loan in my several years as a history graduate student at boston college, i have made countless trips to o\u2019neill library. i\u2019ve used it as my office before i had an office, as my living room when mine was hot and stuffy, and as a resource for information on a host of topics. beyond its comforts, the stacks and the microfilm, however, i truly rely on the staff the most. it has been my experience that when i needed something obscure, the people who can help you are those in interlibrary loan. as a student of history, i often need things that had small publication runs, such as books of statistical figures that interested only turn-of-the-century social workers. the interlibrary loan department has fetched dozens of books like those for my seminar papers and my dissertation. old books, new books, they are able to find them and have them ready for me within a few days. typically, that small window of time has been crucial, as i had a deadline looming and desperately needed the text. on the other hand, the folks in interlibrary loan have also forgiven when i\u2019ve forgotten to return the books they found for me. i\u2019m afraid i am often one of those people\u2014full of good intentions to read a book promptly and return it to the library, but in reality both overcommitted and forgetful. i have found more than one message from ill staff on my answering machine, asking very nicely for me to return whatever the department has dug up for me. the staff skills\u2014tracking down other people\u2019s dissertations, ancient newspapers, and texts that are more often in storage elsewhere than on a proper shelf\u2014has contributed heavily to my research and allowed it to grow and change. when one is working on a doctoral dissertation, one depends heavily on the good will, skills, and time management of others. i have certainly received those things in abundance from the staff at o\u2019neill library\u2019s interlibrary loan department.

college libraries began a major effort in 2004 to enhance library support for the communication department , which is now the largest undergraduate department at bc with more than a thousand students. the effort began with the hiring of a new communication librarian, ken liss , dedicated solely to the department and charged with: expanding and improving the communication collection; providing research and teaching support; and developing other services for faculty and students to reflect the growth of the major. here is a subject area highlight on some of the collections work that ken has been involved in since his appointment: during the summer and early fall, a major effort was made to enhance the libraries' collection of communication journals. as of this fall, the boston college libraries have, in print or electronic form, 80% of those journals identified as essential by boston college faculty and by authors of textbooks on communication research. subscriptions to additional journals will begin with the 2005 issues. also this fall, the libraries added two key new communication databases - communication abstracts and communication & mass media complete - to the electronic offerings available for the boston college community. these databases significantly enhance research access to the communication literature and integration with both the libraries' print collections and with electronic and print resources in related disciplines (i.e psychology, sociology, gender studies, political science, etc.). enhancements to the journal collections and electronic databases put into effect this year will ensure these library resources are in place to support the research needs of communication faculty and students. ongoing pressures on book purchasing budgets, which are being felt in all disciplines due to the growing need for electronic resources and rapid increases in journal prices, may require additional support to ensure that the monograph collection remains strong. but as 2004 comes to an end, this growing academic department is well-supported by the collections and services in the bc libraries. questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter

credits american irish musical interpreters, 1850 - 1975 patrick sarsfield gilmore, 1829-1892: father of the american concert band the most important bandleader before john philip sousa, p.s. gilmore was born in 1829 and spent his youth in ballygar, county galway, ireland. after immigrating to boston in 1849, p.s. gilmore rose to prominence as a bandmaster, concert organizer, and composer, becoming one of the premier american musical figures of the 19th century. p.s. gilmore was inspired by the musical precision of british army bands he had heard in ireland, where he learned to play the e-flat cornet from the bandleader patrick keating. p.s. gilmore quickly established himself in boston as an outstanding soloist, and led the boston brigade band and the salem brass band. as a bandleader, he undertook a succession of ambitious projects, guiding his bands in innovative musical directions. gilmore's band playing grand march from tannhaiiser * p.s. gilmore helped reshape the traditional military brass band into a civilian performing entity, incorporating woodwinds and performing orchestral repertoire. during the civil war, his band accompanied the 24th massachusetts regiment to the front. his wartime compositions included \"when johnny comes marching home,\" inspired in part by \"johnny we hardly knew ye,\u201d an irish anti-war marching song. his grand 1864 concert for the inauguration of the louisiana governor inspired p.s. gilmore to create the 1869 national peace jubilee, near what is now copley plaza in boston. a 30,000 seat coliseum was specially built for the event. gilmore\u2019s 1872 world peace jubilee in boston seated 50,000, marking the end of the franco-prussian war and featuring premier european ensembles, including the american debut of \u201cwaltz king\u201d johann strauss and his orchestra. several popular traditions we enjoy today began with p.s. gilmore and his band, such as the fourth of july concerts on the boston common. in 1873, p.s. gilmore became leader of the 22nd new york regiment band, and it is his band that began the practice of greeting the new year in times square. on land leased from p.t. barnum, he established gilmore's garden, later named madison square garden. in 1891, gilmore and his band made a few commercial recordings for thomas edison, and the recordings proved so popular that the band continued recording for many years after gilmore\u2019s death in 1892. for more information on p.s. gilmore, see the select bibliography created for this exhibit. \u00ab back | next \u00bb maintained:

morrison in new york city, two exceptional fiddle players from ireland revitalized traditional irish music during the 1920s and 1930s through their recordings. michael coleman (1891-1945) and james morrison (1893-1947) had brought to new york a memorized repertoire of traditional irish reels, jigs, and hornpipes from their native county sligo, and there were paid opportunities to perform these traditional tunes in dance halls and other new york venues. both coleman and morrison were also invited to record some of these tunes, and the skill and artistry on these 78rpm recordings established standards for traditional irish dance music that still inspire irish musicians. michael coleman playing lord gordon * while the two fiddle players did not perform or record together, their lives had many parallels. in sligo, where coleman and morrison grew up eight miles apart, there was a thriving community of traditional dance music and fiddle players. coleman and morrison learned their fiddle music by ear, absorbing influences from fiddle players and pipers who lived in or traveled through their rural communities. coleman and morrison also knew the traditional dance steps that accompanied these tunes. within the sligo style and repertoire, each player had his own individual sound; historian harry bradshaw has noted that michael coleman had a full and sweeping use of the bow, whereas james morrison was known for his rhythmic, danceable style using the upper part of the bow. potential employment prospects in the u.s. compelled both c the technology of recordings helped traditional dance music from irish rural areas take its place in an urban setting. the technical brilliance and emotional depth of these fiddle recordings also had a profound effect on musicians in isolated rural irish areas, where the sligo style of fiddling had not been heard before. the impact of coleman, morrison, and others continues today, as many traditional irish instrumentalists worldwide still emulate the style and repertoire recorded in new york in the early part of the 20th century. for more information on michael coleman and james morrison, see the select bibliography created for this

fair, where he performed in the \u201cirish village\u201d in the same venue as his future wife, lily foley, herself billed as \u201cireland's exponent of gaelic song.\u201d he subsequently studied opera in milan, performed in london venues, and eventually made his u.s. opera debut at the manhattan opera house in 1909 opposite soprano luisa tetrazzini. the new york post received john mccormack warmly, praising him as a \u201cpure lyric tenor.\u201d he quickly became a favorite with new york audiences, later performing at the metropolitan opera with soprano nellie melba. the manhattan opera house hosted john mccormack\u2019s first american recital in 1909, and his renditions of irish ballads proved an immediate hit. arguably more at ease as a recitalist than in operatic productions, his recitals and recordings came to include a wide repertoire, from italian arias and light classical pieces to german lieder, irish folk songs, and tin pan alley compositions such as \u201cmy wild irish rose.\u201d john mccormack\u2019s concerts drew sellout crowds worldwide in the most prestigious venues, including carnegie hall and covent garden. his victor 78-rpm records sold in the millions, and he recorded over 800 discs. in addition to recordings, john mccormack established himself in radio and in the film, song o\u2019 my heart. through all these media, john mccormack both elevated the \u201cirish tenor\u201d genre in america, and earned the reputation as the most versatile singer of his time. john mccormack frequently used his energy, fame, and talent to raise funds for charity. in recognition, pope pius xi raised the tenor to the papal peerage in 1928. a devout catholic, john mccormack sang to a million people at the 1932 eucharistic congress in dublin. the event was broadcast throughout ireland, as well as by the bbc and in continental europe. john mccormack singing i hear you calling me * towards the end of john mccormack\u2019s life, the popularity of the full-voiced style of singing was waning, in favor of a new popular singing style that depended more on the use of the microphone. in the peak years of his career, however, john mccormack\u2019s consummate artistry, expressiveness, and breadth of repertoire made him a household name. john mccormack is considered one of the great mozartian singers of his time, and in 2006, the library of congress honored his 1916 recording of mozart\u2019s \"il mio tesoro\" from don giovanni ,adding the recording to the united states national recording registry. for more information on john mccormack, see the select

under cardinal man\u2019s leadership, the catholic church and the vietnamese socialist government have established a new and growing collaboration. according to father giulietti, \u201cthe development of a major library at the service of both catholic vietnamese and readers in general is a positive step toward dialogue and reconciliation on many levels\u201d. the team met over several days to visit the site of the proposed library, to visit other structures being rehabilitated around the proposed site and to meet with cardinal man and his \u201cad hoc library staff\u201d. this library will represent a reawakening of the catholic intellectual tradition in vietnam by providing a place for study and reflection with access to books, journals and electronic resources. cardinal man has a grand vision for this proposed library with large meeting rooms, training rooms, a dining facility, computer research areas, reader spaces and of course, room for book stacks. the library team came up with a design which will serve the needs of the many religious leaders, scholars and students for years to come. the visit also included a side trip to cu chi, to visit the daughters of charity\u2019s aids hospice, home to a few of the children and adults in vietnam dying of hiv/aids. cu chi is located not far from the famous cu chi tunnels which enabled vietnamese fighters to operate for years

kathryn deiss of the arl office of leadership and management services (olms). in addition to exercises about participants' personal career vision and professional strengths and talents, the workshops included sessions about organizational culture, group development, and effective problem-solving, including collaborative work on case studies. professional workshops included an excellent presentation about grant writing by barbara davis, a grant-writing instructor at the university of st. thomas in st. paul and st. mary's university in minneapolis. dr. richard krueger of the

college libraries newsletter - fall 2013 volume 14 number 4 fall 2013 studies in the spirituality of jesuits studies in the spirituality of jesuits is a series of monographs that began in 1969. due to the efforts of the o'neill library staff, the entire archive, consisting now of 45 volumes, has recently become available through boston college . scholars throughout the world can now access this unique record of developments in the society of jesus, especially in the united states, in the years following the second vatican council (1962-65). as its name suggests, the series offers a series of reflections on the interior life of the community rather than a chronicle of changing institutional commitments, personalities, and statistics. its reach embraces the theological rationales, historical traditions, and lived experience of contemporary american jesuits. studies documents this unsettling postconciliar period, when the society of jesus, like the church throughout the world, struggled to recalibrate its role in a rapidly changing world. the effort continues to this day, and so does the series. some historical background may be illuminating. in the late 1950's, father george ganss, s.j., began a project to translate many of the foundation documents of the society of jesus. until the postwar period, it may be recalled, many church documents were available only in latin, since it was commonly believed at the time that translation inevitably risked distortion. starting at marquette university and then moving to st. louis university, father ganss worked to translate the constitutions of the society of jesus, the autobiography of st. ignatius, and joseph de guibert's the jesuits: their spiritual doctrine and practice . the work gradually coalesced into the institute of jesuit sources, which under the direction of john padberg, s.j. continues to translate and publish original works pertaining to jesuit history and spirituality. the institute (ijs) was the original parent organization for studies. ijs clearly antedated vatican ii, but the council gave it a new mission. its decree on religious life, perfectae caritatis , promulgated by pope paul vi on october 28, 1965, encouraged all religious communities to reassess their mission in the modern world by looking to their original charisms, as embodied in the lives and writings of their founders. this mandate fit perfectly into the work already undertaken by ijs. immediately after the council, the ten american provincial superiors formed the seminar on jesuit spirituality. each provincial appointed one member, under the chairmanship of father ganss. the group was charged with identifying and addressing some of the major challenges the american jesuits faced in their work of renewal. their findings were published in studies in the spirituality of jesuits, which first appeared in september 1969. in the early years, the journal reflected these concerns, dealing with topics like commitment, ministry, social justice, and celibacy, important topics not only for american jesuits but for the entire church. in 2002, the jesuit conference in washington, the official sponsor of the seminar and publisher of studies, appointed richard blake, s.j., to become chair and editor. with the editor remaining a full-time professor of film studies in the fine arts department at boston college, the journal severed its editorial relationship with ijs and st. louis university and became an independent operation directly under the jesuit conference and based at boston college. the business office at ijs continues to manage subscriptions, typesetting, printing and mailing. after the move, studies became a quarterly, in keeping with the standard of other academic journals, but it maintains the monograph format. each year three new members are appointed for three-year terms, while the chair serves indefinitely at the pleasure of the conference. although the seminar members are all jesuits, the studies welcomes and solicits contributions from non-jesuit scholars, men and women of all faiths, interested in furthering understanding of ignatian spirituality, history, and practice. richard a. blake, s.j. editor, studies in the spirituality of jesuits questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston college libraries",

acquires an unusual collection of art journals below are two statements by high-ranking, 20th-century politicos; to whom would you attribute these statements? \"we are in the hands of the food companies, whose economic clout and advertising make it possible for them to prescribe what we can and cannot eat. city folk, living through the winter largely on canned food, are already at their mercy, but now they attack the countryside with their refined flour, sugar, and white bread.\" \"best of luck in your work to free humanity from one of its most dangerous poisons.\" [in a message sent

anti-vivisection laws state-sponsored cutting-edge cancer research encouragement for regular health checkups, especially for early detection of cancer in women laws that restricted the manufacture and

for meat skim milk substitution for whole milk ultimately, a raw diet consisting only of fresh fruits and vegetables all of the above points came about not just in germany, but germany during the rule of the national socialists. the first quote is from heinrich himmler, and the second from hitler himself. how is one to assimilate such contradictory information? how can one of the most monstrous regimes in history have sponsored health reforms that we today might label as \"progressive?\" does the preoccupation with nature and organicism lead to barbarism? these are the sorts of distressing moral questions that the collection the title of this article refers to provokes, and it is with these questions in mind that the following should be approached. recently the burns library acquired a run of 20 issues of a german art magazine published during the years directly prior and during world war ii. while many academic journals continued during this time period, this was no ordinary journal: it was edited and published by the central press of the nazi party in munich. infamous high-ranking nazis of the likes of albert speer and fritz todt were editors and, as we shall see, regular contributors. moreover, a statement of responsibility on the title page indicates that the journal was \"... edited ... for the monitoring of the entire spiritual and ideological training and education of the nsdap\" (i.e. the nazi party). yet, and perhaps despite its chilling purpose, the journal itself is remarkably free of obviously propagandistic articles, and there is scant mention, even in later issues, that a total war is going on that will utterly destroy germany. what's going on here? the journal was published in a large, 28 x 35 cm. format, with mostly black-and-white photos but also with color plates. it was sold in two versions (\"ausgaben\"): ausgabe a included only fine arts, while ausgabe b also included a section entitled \"die baukunst\" - architecture - and cost twice what ausgabe a cost. published from january 1937 (as die kunst im dritten reich , january 1937-august 1938) through - amazingly - august/september 1944, burns library holdings are comprised of ausgabe b issues from january 1940 through december 1943. before proceeding it is well to remember that, once in power, the nazis moved swiftly to take over all cultural institutions in germany: education, music, literature, theater, and the fine arts. no effort was spared to bring every facet of life into compliance with nazi ideology, which had as its base value a pseudo-biological outlook that was concerned with the preservation of, as they put it, \"the german germ plasm.\" hence the phrase referring to \"spiritual and ideological training and education\" on the title page. recall, too, that before wwi hitler had been a bohemian youth in vienna who had twice applied for - and twice been denied - entrance into the viennese academy of art, and who had made a meager income by selling his watercolors as postcards. so a nazi-edited art journal is not surprising, given hitler's perception that art was to be a focal point for the revolutionizing of the german people. turning towards the individual issues themselves, each issue's fine arts section (ausgabe a) would normally have articles on both illustration - drawing and painting - and the plastic arts of sculpture and ceramics. every issue would feature an artist and his work, usually on his birthday; e.g. \"raffael schuster-woldan zum 70. geburtstag des kunstlers.\" still lifes and landscapes were two safe themes that painters could safely explore. like their soviet counterparts, artists working during the nazi regime had to take the content of their work into consideration every time if they expected to work. nothing that even hinted at an abstract theme - labeled by the nazis as \"degenerate\" - would have been tolerated. the result for die kunst is that many of the full-color plates are, echoing hannah arendt's famous phrase, dull to the point of banality. for example, here is a canvas by the artist ferdinand georg waldm\u00fcller. occasionally preliminary sketches would be included in an extended look at the creative work of a given artist; to the left is one example. portraiture tended to fare better; here the topics were both more poignant and diverse. with but a few exceptions, portraiture was the only place that this journal admitted that a war was going on. for example, the portrait of the sailor on the right is that of the highly-decorated u-boat captain, g\u00fcnther prien. prien's boat went down, with all hands on board, on 7 march 1941. the pensive look of the next portrait, also of a u-boat sailor, belies the danger of that branch of the kriegsmarine: roughly 75% of germany's submariners would perish during the war. however most of the portraiture featured in die kunst was of a more prosaic nature, as the following images display: self portrait, siegward sprotte venus my daughter elizabeth similarly, when one thinks of sculpture from this time period one thinks of propagandistic art of the sort done by arno breker, and one can indeed find such work in die kunst im deutschen reich . that said, here too non-political, even sensitive work may be found, as illustrated in the following two images. portrait of a young girl rudolf a. agricola slumbering and war memorial michael drobil albert speer was the editor and contributor to this section, and the below article, on the furniture of paul ludwig troost (1879-1934) is a typical example of his work, and for that matter is also a typical example of the work of troost - the architect featured - who was hitler's favorite architect. note the juxtaposition of the prosaic cabinet next to the chilling effect of the conference room. above: interior design of a hotel by the architect heinrich micha\ufffdlis the article presented below, about reich minister for armaments and ammunition dr. fritz todt's autobahn, does not mention that this pre-war project was accomplished through the use of forced labor. but perhaps the most compelling article in the entire corpus of this collection was a piece on the heinkel factory in oranienburg. oranienburg, a town in the northeastern (brandenburg) area of germany, was the site not only of the heinkel werke, but also of a chemical factory that the allies thought was manufacturing materiel for an atom bomb, a rail yard that served as a trans-shipment point for lines into the eastern front, as well as the infamous sachsenhausen concentration camp. like all of the pieces in this journal, what the articles don't say is as important - if not more so - than what they do. entitled sch\u00f6nheit der arbeit - the beauty of labor, the article focuses on ecological and environmental aspects of what was in the 1930s a new factory complex. this complex was a branch factory of the firm ernst heinkel flugzeugwerke , the manufacturer of the he 111 twin-engined bomber used by the luftwaffe in campaigns like the battle of britain and the invasion of poland. images presented below focus on the well-lit by natural light buildings, the worker's village surrounding the factory, a school, and exercise facilities, including a gymnasium and an olympic-sized swimming pool. all of this is in keeping with the ecological and preventative health initiatives supported by the national socialists and very briefly outlined at the beginning of this review. what this article does not say, however, is that the workers at the heinkel werke needed all of those recreational facilities to give them the strength they required to keep up with the demanding pace of pre-war armaments buildup. such long hours were exacted that one german physician predicted that at that pace the german labor force would suffer a collective breakdown with worse implications than the anarchy that followed 1918. nor does it say that the physicians assigned to the heinkel werke were ensconced in the factory not only to care for the workers' health, but to report on any slackers. as in the soviet union, work in nazi germany was considered a duty, and slacking, or not working, or even not being able to work, were considered treasonous. the title of this article then, in that sense, is telling: sch\u00f6nheit der arbeit . after hitler and his party came to power in 1933 the free german labor unions were abolished and replaced by a national socialist organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront \ufffd the german labor front. the beauty of labor was a branch of the daf that was responsible for appeasing workers into conformity and unquestioned loyalty through programs designed to make the workplace more comfortable; this article was designed to show the success of that program by depicting the heinkel werke in oranienburg as a model place to live and work. at the beginning of this review i noted the morally ambiguous nature of nazi party health and ecological reforms. how could what seems to be good come out of what we know to have been one of the worst regimes in history? a partial answer, as illustrated in this journal, is that all of the health, environmental and ecological initiatives had, as an underlying purpose, the mobilization of german population for hitler's murderous vision. as a hitler youth manual put it, \"nutrition is not a private matter!\" as a coda to this review, note the children gathered in front of the houses in the bottom left of the last photo. it is likely that many, if not most of them perished during the war. allied bombers - usaaf b-17s and b-24s and raf lancasters - pounded oranienburg mercilessly. as a consequence oranienburg has more unexploded bombs in its soil than anywhere else in germany, as this article describes. beauty of labor, indeed. david richtmyer rare books librarian and senior cataloger burns library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board .

college libraries newsletter - fall 2013 volume 14 number 4 fall 2013 making history public true students of history know that the study of history is not confined to learning dates, names, and events, or passively receiving information in order to pass courses. rather, historians search for insight into the ideas and lives of men and women of earlier times. studying history helps us to see the world through different eyes, and the ability to see events from a perspective other than our own is crucially important in our increasingly globalized society. being a historian means being always willing to ask new questions of primary sources--the documents, archives, books, letters, newspapers, audio and video recordings, and artifacts created by participants in past events. students in history courses regularly write research papers based on primary sources, in which they ask new questions and offer new insights into historical events as diverse as the vietnam war, the italian renaissance, fdr's new deal, the viking invasions, and the end of colonialism in africa. but too often, only the professor teaching the course gets to see the fruits of her students' painstaking work in primary sources. \"making history public\" is an effort to change that, and to reach for a larger audience for our history students' research. it's an exciting new collaboration between the history department and the boston college libraries, inaugurated in the 2012-13 academic year. the core of the program is an undergraduate history course taught by different history faculty members each semester, the goal of which is to produce an exhibition of materials from the boston college libraries. the idea for the program was developed last year in several meetings that brought together librarians, historians, and deans. \"making history public\" would not have begun without the ideas, suggestions, and support from tom wall (university librarian), bridget burke (associate university librarian for special collections), david quigley (dean of the college and graduate school of arts and sciences), and robin fleming (history department chair). i taught the first iteration of \"making history public\" last fall on the topic of \"books around the world, 1400-1800.\" the fruits of my students' work are currently on display in the history department's quarters in stokes hall (third floor, south). all semester last fall, ten students and i met for class in the splendid, elegant setting of the burns library's irish room, where we pored over a wealth of books boston college owns that were printed in europe and colonial north america in the first centuries after gutenberg's invention of the printing press. please come visit the show before it ends on december 1. i hope you will delight as much as the students and i did when you see such beautiful old books about every topic imaginable, from politics and theology to science, travel, and fairy tales. i hope the exhibition conveys at least a hint of the great fun we had finding, thinking about, and writing for our visitors about gulliver's travels , the copernican universe, a sufi prayer book, a cookbook, and cinderella and her glass slipper . my name was listed as the course instructor, but the librarians' and my colleagues' contributions to the course and resulting exhibition were even more important than mine. justine sundaram, senior reference librarian at the burns library, shared with us her incomparable knowledge of the burns collections, and helped the students choose books for their portions of the exhibition. elliot brandow, senior reference librarian at o'neill library, was our embedded librarian in the course; he helped the students find scholarly literature that shed light on the historical context of the books they chose. barbara adams hebard and david richtmyer of the burns library gave special presentations to the class. once the students had written labels explaining and interpreting their books, professor karen k. miller of the history department, whose field is public history, edited our text. bill donovan and his colleagues in the digital imaging department produced beautiful digital photos of our books. kevin tringale, exhibits specialist at bapst library, took many photographs for us, but more importantly also designed and installed a beautiful exhibition in stokes hall. students and faculty in subsequent \"making history public\" courses will mount exhibitions on comic books and american values in the 1970s, the boston common, and early maps of the americas. stop by the history department (stokes hall, third floor south) to see a display of the latest historical research by our students! virginia reinburg associate professor, history department questions,

children\u2019s literature , amanda cockrell writes, \"anansi, also spelled anancy, is a trickster figure of west african folklore. like most tricksters, anancy can be both comic and heroic. brought by african slaves to the west indies, he is a spirit of rebellion and of the underdog, a symbol of creativity, craftiness, and freedom who can upend the social order, marry the princess, and defy death.\" the burns library\u2019s anansi folk tales collection is the largest collection of anansi folk tales in existence. it is also part of the williams ethnological collection. this collection includes more than 10,000 volumes and eleven linear feet of manuscript materials documenting the history, life and culture of the people of the british west indies and their african antecedents.

highlights from manuscript collections at the john j. burns library (march 2011) this exhibit features select manuscript collections documenting irish and irish-americans in greater boston during the 19th and 20th centuries. primary sources in these collections offer insights into careers of such individuals as p.s. gilmore, \u201cfather of the american concert band\u201d; congressman tip o\u2019neill; george d. cahill, a late 19th century irish nationalist; charles maginnis, designer of early buildings on the boston college chestnut hill campus; and journalist and poet katherine e. conway, who in 1883 became the first woman editor of the boston pilot. other highlighted items include trans-atlantic correspondence of the prendergast family during the 19th century irish famine and the sermons (1835-1840) of irish emigrant fr. michael healy. the boston college eagle: origins and development of the university mascot (summer 2005) though adopted less than a century ago, the eagle was quickly integrated into the university's institutional identity, and has become the paramount public symbol representing boston college to the outside world. this online exhibit looks at the efforts to establish the eagle as the boston college mascot. it includes different artistic interpretations, as well as the eagle's continuing role and use in university life. guests and friends: rev. francis w. sweeney, s.j. and his contributions to cultural life at boston college (fall 2004) rev. francis w. sweeney, sj was a popular faculty member in the english department and the founder of the humanities series (now the lowell humanities series), the well-respected lecture series that continues to this day. this exhibit considers both sweeney's role as the founder of the humanities series and the importance of the lecture series to boston college. free state art: judging ireland by its book covers (summer 2004) the irish free state government established an g\u00fam, the publications branch of the department of education (later oifig an tsol\u00e1thair/the state publishing agency) in 1925-1926 to supply textbooks and fiction in irish for the educational and recreation needs of the newly independent ireland. this exhibit consists of an g\u00fam covers from the irish collection of the burns library and from private collections in the boston area. thomas p. o'neill, jr. and boston college (spring 2002; updated, fall 2004) despite tip o'neill's many contributions both to boston college and the nation as a whole, his achievements are in danger of fading from popular memory. years after his graduation from boston college, o'neill remained fond of his alma mater and his alma mater celebrated his achievements. this exhibit hopes to inform and remind people of o'neill's legacy as a boston college student and alumnus. teams of destiny: the first fifty years of boston college football (fall 2001) this exhibit celebrates four of the greatest squads or \"teams of destiny\" that played in the first fifty years of the sports program. profiled are the 1899 team (the strongest team of the nineteenth century), the 1920 and 1928 eastern championship teams, and the sugar bowl team of 1940. updated: february 1, 2012 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Occasional Web-Based

bc home > libraries > about > services > course reserves information services blackboard vista and library course reserves the libraries have created technology that allows you to easily post a link to your course reserve list in your blackboard vista site. if you already have a link to course reserves that you put in as a web link in blackboard vista, we recommend that you remove that link and replace it with this new link. why? two reasons: the new link is based on a dynamic technology that will regenerate the link in case the section number changes from one semester to another. you will never have to worry again about changing the link\u2014it will automatically adapt. the course reserve list generated by this new link is streamlined and easier for students to view and use. here are instructions for adding the new link in blackboard vista. start in the build tab. click on the add content link button and choose library course reserves . click on create library course reserves . add a title, e.g., course reserves, in the title box and click on the save button. a course reserves link for your class list will appear. for more detailed visual instructions try this tutorial . you may also use blackboard vista to post scanned material or links to external materials yourself. these items would appear only on your blackboard vista site, and not in the libraries' course reserve system. consult with the blackboard vista administrator for assistance. students viewing course reserves students can sign-in to the library course reserves service to view their current course schedule and any readings on reserve in the library for those courses. the course reserves service can also be used to search for items on reserve by course code and section (for example, entering en101.02 will display items currently on reserve for english 101, section 02). smart phone users can also access course reserves through the libraries mobile services link. how to put items on reserve \u2013 faculty instructions items may be placed on course reserves for fall, spring or summer sessions. fall and spring semester are two distinct periods, while the summer sessions make up the third reserve time period. requests (reading lists, syllabi) may be submitted to the email contacts listed at the end of this page. contact the appropriate library on the campus where the course is taught. o'neill library (including media) processes the reserve collections for the school of arts and sciences (except fine arts), education, management, nursing, and the woods college of advancing studies. the bapst art library, the social work library, the educational resource center, theology and ministry library and the law library focus on subject-related materials for their specific user populations. need clarification of reserve locations? call 617-552-2297. time frames course reserves is a student-focused service. to ensure that students have access to all materials needed by the start of classes, please submit your course reserve requests in accordance with the following time frames: fall semester: july 15 spring semester: november 15 summer sessions: april 15 some items may need to be ordered, scanned, recalled, or repaired and there may be a significant delay between the time requests are submitted and the time the material is available for student use. because of this, requests submitted after the above dates may not be ready the first week of classes. before making assignments in class based on reserve readings, check holmes or call the reserves department in the appropriate library to make sure your materials are listed in the course reserves catalog, ready for student use. common course materials books: almost all reserve books come from the circulating collections of the libraries. new copies may be purchased for reserve if there are no copies in the collection. in most cases one copy will suffice for each class. additional copies may be added if there is demand based on use. books borrowed from libraries other than the libraries at boston college cannot be placed on reserve. journal articles/book chapters: library staff will routinely scan and provide online access to journal articles, book chapters, lecture notes, sample exams, etc., if allowable under current copyright guidelines. the libraries' policy for placing photocopied or scanned images of published copyrighted materials on reserve is derived from the fair use provisions of the u.s. copyright act of 1976. the libraries are also guided by the principles in the association of research libraries' applying fair use in the development of electronic reserves systems. if there is already an online version of the article requested in the libraries' electronic journal collection, a link will be made to the existing online article or the article will be downloaded and scanned and placed on a local server for ease of use by students. each article or book chapter, must contain a complete bibliographic citation. if making a copy does not fall within the fair use guidelines below, the copyright holder must give permission for you to use the material. when producing copies for course reserves, library staff will usually limit the amount of scanning that they will do to one chapter from a book or one article from a journal issue. when multiple chapters from books are requested, the book itself will be placed on reserve. media: all types of media and software may be placed on reserve at the media center in o'neill library. contact the media center directly at 617-552-4466 to learn more about the services offered there and how copyright may affect your reserve requests. media items, regardless of format, borrowed from libraries other than the libraries at boston college cannot be placed on media reserve. to reserve a media item for class or a short term, use the daily reserve request . for regular semester reserve, use the closed reserve request . to request media center audio items to be streamed for placement in blackboard courses, use the digitization request form . course packets: when a large number of articles are needed for a course or when materials are restricted by copyright and require permission from the publisher before being placed on course reserves, a course pack is an alternative to using the libraries course reserves. the course pack coordinator at the bookstore will obtain permissions from individual publishers. once permissions are obtained the course packet will be sold at the bookstore like any other textbook for the convenience of students. course reserves for visually impaired students students with visual impairments should work with the assistant dean for students with disabilities to obtain textbooks or course readings in a format that can be used on text readers such as jaws. if they are not yet available in text-reader format, the conversion may be performed in the o'neill library digitization lab. however, students needing this service must first contact the assistant dean at 617-552-3470 in order to get the process started. end of semester activity unless notified otherwise, materials will be removed from reserve at the end of the semester. course packets will be returned to campus addresses or may be picked up with advance notice. library owned materials are returned to the open shelves. electronic reserves lists display only for active courses i.e. those courses being used by the students during a single semester. contacts need more information? more

the vast majority can be found using quest or holmes: they each have individual catalog records just like printed books. this is generally true whether contained in a collection or purchased individually. however, there are exceptions: some e-book collections are delivered essentially, as \u201cdatabases\u201d; these e-books may only be \u201cfindable\u201d from within the database itself, and are treated as \u201cresearch databases\u201d in the libraries website. sally wyman , collection development librarian. to learn more about e-book collections at boston college, talk to your subject librarian or see the boston college libraries e-books libguide . here you\u2019ll get a better sense of the array of collections, tips for searching for e-books, links to e-book reader reviews, and more. sally wyman collection development librarian, o'neill library questions, comments?

(contact a librarian or archivist if you need help: burnsref@bc.edu ) one key advantage to studying a digital copy of a document is the way in which it allows the researcher to closely examine a physical object. there is often much to be gleaned from the appearance of a letter \u2013 the paper itself, the handwriting and spelling, and the way that a document has fared over time. examining the address leaf or envelope can also add to one\u2019s understanding of the contents of a letter. the leary letters, for example, are written on union army stationery, which, although not unique, is interesting to see. in order to view an example, go to the online finding aid for the leary letters; click on the link next to the item you wish to view \u2013 in this case, folder 46. once the page opens, click on the thumbnail of the envelope, then choose \u201citem 17\u201d to see one example of an envelope from the leary letters. at the time the leary letters were digitized, only a few details were known about michael leary, most of which were gleaned from secondary sources on the subject of his military service. prior to their digitization i had not taken the opportunity to study the collection, but i suspected that some research might answer several basic questions about leary and desmond, including the question of whether they were able to build a life together after the war. in an attempt to see what could be added to the biographical sketch in the collection\u2019s finding aid, i utilized ancestry.com; americanancestors.org; the historical boston globe database; city directories; and the burns library\u2019s university archives. american ancestors is the website of the new england historic genealogical society. members have access to databases which include records of massachusetts births, marriages, and deaths. nine boston city directories can be accessed via tufts university\u2019s digital collections and archives resource boston streets: mapping directory data the following resources are available through the boston college libraries: ancestry.com is widely known as a resource for genealogy, but is also an invaluable tool to discover other information about united states citizens, including where they lived and with whom, employment and salary information, and additional detail about immigration and naturalization, military service, etc. last fall, based on a faculty request, history bibliographer elliot brandow announced that the university libraries had acquired an institutional membership to ancestry.com. when asked for feedback recently, professor jim o\u2019toole assured me that those working in bc\u2019s history department are enthusiastic (his word was \u201coverjoyed\u201d) users of this resource. the historical boston globe database is a good place to find obituaries (another excellent source of personal information). and, if the person whom you are researching ever made it into the news \u2013 for reasons good or ill \u2013 you may discover it there. for example, after learning the names of the leary children, it came to light that two of their sons attended boston college \u2013 thus possibly explaining how it is that burns came to own the letters (a detail either unrecorded by early library staff, or lost to time). the university archives at the burns library provided more detail about the lives of the two leary children who attended boston college (although the sources i used from it are not yet digitized, they may be used by researchers at the burns library). knowing their names and dates is almost meaningless, though, compared to what you will learn about them and their world by reading their mail. and, don\u2019t worry \u2013 michael\u2019s handwriting isn\u2019t all that bad! burns staff members look forward to answering questions about our collections and how to access them. information about the archives and manuscript collections at burns can be found in the burns library research guide . shelley barber library/archives assistant, john j. burns library editor of the prendergast letters: correspondence from famine-era ireland 1840-1850 . questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston college libraries", "hrefTitle": "Opportunity For Discovery: The Michael H.

librarians are frequently asked to provide rankings of journals in particular disciplines. though there are many supposedly authoritative lists that rank journals, it might be wise to heed the motto caveat lector \u201cthe controversial policies of journal rankings: evaluating social sciences and humanities.\" quality of specific journals sometimes, the question asked of librarians is \u201chow can i tell if this journal is of good scholarly worth\". to provide a definitive answer is usually difficult without first agreeing on a set of quite precise evaluative criteria. obviously, when such criteria change, the answer often changes. some criteria for evaluating journals: a) impact factor a journal\u2019s impact factor (if) is often used to judge the quality of a journal. one may use the database journal citation reports (jcr) to assess the if of roughly 11,000 institute of scientific information (isi) journals. the if is the frequency with which articles from a journal published in the past two years have been cited in a particular year. isi\u2019s if is calculated by dividing the number of current year citations by the total number of articles published in the two previous years. an if of 2.0 signifies that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited twice. there are numerous question marks associated with ifs. only a small number of journals have ifs, i.e. only those journals indexed by jcr (over 8,000 journals in science and 2,700 in the social sciences). humanities journals are not represented. there is a heavy emphasis on north american titles. with the exception of british and dutch titles, journals from other countries are not well represented. moreover, english language journals predominate. journals that publish longer articles with more citations tend to have higher ifs. journals that publish survey or review articles are often more heavily cited than journals that do not include such documents. in like manner, journals which have editorials, correspondence, reports of meetings, all of which may be cited, can often have much higher ifs than journals that do not. there is no correction for self citations which are often numerous. citations in books are not included. most journals tend to have articles which end up with a wide range of citations. some may be heavily cited, some a little, some not at all. thus, it may be quite misleading to judge an article based on the if of the journal in which it is published. in addition, whatever value ifs have, they can only be used to compare journals within the same discipline. comparing ifs of journals in different subject areas may be valueless. for example, according to journal citation reports , the medical journal with the highest if for 2010 is new journal of medicine (if 53.486). however, the journal with the highest if for journals in veterinary studies, veterinary research , only has an if of 3.765. clearly it can be meaningless to compare the ifs for journals in different fields. another problem is using a journal\u2019s if to assess the scholarly worth of an author who has published in it. one cannot adequately assess an author\u2019s work based on a single metric. as david tempest, associate director of research and academic relations for elsevier, stated \u201cthe papers that an individual published could be zero-cited in a journal with an impact factor of 50. taking the journal\u2019s position as a proxy for individual quality can be misleading.\" proper assessment of an author\u2019s scholarship should be based on a thorough examination of his/her scholarship by experts in that subject area and not by some metric judging the media where he/she has published. a portal that complements the metrics of journal citation reports and that may be useful for ranking both journals and assessing a journal\u2019s quality is scimago journal & country rank . this platform shows the visibility of the journals contained in the scopus\u00ae database from 1996 (bc libraries presently do not provide access to scopus). b) google scholar metrics another tool, the recently introduced google scholar metrics (gsm), offers potentially strong competition to isi\u2019s journal citation report\u2019s impact factor. utilizing gsm\u2019s citation metrics one may gauge the visibility and influence of recent articles in scholarly journals. particularly interesting is gsm\u2019s listing of the top 100 publications in several languages , ordered by their five-year h-index and h-median metrics. information about gsm\u2019s \u201ch\" indices and other bibliometrics employed is available here . c) eigenfactor score and article influence score like the impact factor, the eigenfactor score and article influence score use citation data to evaluate the influence of a journal in relation to other journals. eigenfactor uses data gathered for five years to calculate how often articles from the journal have been cited. it takes account of which journals have cited the journal in question so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals. there is a check on journal self citation, e.g. references from one article to another article in the same journal are removed. \u201cthe article influence determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication. it is calculated by dividing a journal\u2019s eigenfactor score by the number of articles in the journal, normalized as a fraction of all articles in all publications. this measure is roughly analogous to the 5-year journal impact factor in that it is a ratio of a journal\u2019s citation influence to the size of the journal\u2019s article contribution over a period of five years. the mean article influence score is 1.00. a score greater than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has above-average influence. a score less than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has below-average influence.\" the database jcr provides the eigenfactor and article influence scores for its journals. d) who\u2019s the publisher? a hint about journal quality may be provided by the society, association, organization publishing it. prestigious organizations like the american psychological association, institute of electrical and electronics engineers, american medical association, and so on publish a number of journals that tend to be very well respected. still, smaller, less well known scholarly bodies may publish highly regarded journals and though they may be read far less often than some of the better known journals this does not, of course, necessarily detract from their scholarly value. e) editorial board the scholarly reputation of the members of the editorial board may provide tips about the quality of the journal. however, though useful, this strategy is clearly open to strong elements of subjectivity. f) where indexed where a journal is indexed may give a clue as to its quality. the database ulrichsweb global serials directory provides detailed indexing information on over 300,000 journals, both academic and popular. of course, it isn\u2019t necessarily the case that if a journal is widely indexed its value is higher. g) journal acceptance/rejection rates methods for determining acceptance/rejection rates may differ from journal to journal. journal x may calculate the acceptance rate based on the number of articles accepted out of all articles submitted. journal y may calculate the rate from the number of articles accepted out of the articles sent out for peer review. in the latter case journal y will have a higher acceptance rate. another factor is the disciplinary area. a subject area for which few scholars write articles may have a higher acceptance rate than other more popular subject areas. there are strategies for locating acceptance/rejection rates. sometimes they may be located by looking at the information for authors or submission guidelines found on a journal\u2019s website. another strategy useful for some subject areas is to access the library database cabell\u2019s directories of publishing opportunities : business directories (accounting, economics & finance, management, marketing); educational directories (educational curriculum & methods, educational psychology & administration, educational technology & library science). these cabell directories frequently include journal acceptance/rejection rates. h) peer-reviewed a traditional criterion for evaluating the quality of a journal is to ascertain whether it is peer reviewed (refereed) or not. however, the challenge here is that often there is a very wide range of quality in peer reviewed journals. a journal declaring itself to be peer reviewed does not necessarily indicate that it possesses high scholarly quality and prestige. one may consult the database ulrichsweb global serials directory to determine if a journal is peer-reviewed. i) are publication fees required? many open access journals require authors to pay publication fees. this is not necessarily a red flag. numerous quality oa journals, some very prestigious, have a system of \u201cauthor pays\". however, there\u2019s the swiftly growing problem of sham journals whose sole rationale is to make a profit. such journals, often with very credible scholarly names, will charge authors high publication fees and will publish most articles submitted. they are clearly fake journals and it\u2019s likely that more and more serious academics are being caught in the trap. a useful resource for determining some of these spurious journals is jeffrey beall's list of predatory,

at boston college tei, gephi, wordle, zotero. at first glance, these terms can look a bit like alphabet soup. however, to a digital humanist, these applications are as common as opening a book. with technology becoming more prevalent, scholars are more likely to incorporate technology into their teaching. digital humanities combines scholarly humanities research with technology. it focuses on both digitized and born digital materials combining materials from the traditional humanities disciplines with technologically based tools. digital humanities provides opportunities for increased collaboration among scholars, librarians, technology, and instructional design staff. the library will play a leading role in providing support through the integration of digital resources, methodologies, technologies, and analytical tools with traditional resources in a multi-edge approach to the humanities. serving as a connector between groups, the library has a proven track record of organizing and connecting information sources and will be able to successfully merge research materials with cutting edge technology. ideas and resources are already being exchanged among library staff ensuring that we will be able to meet the needs of the boston college community in the realm of digital humanities. these are: creation of the digital humanities interest group [dhig]: currently focusing on educating library staff, this group exists to exchange ideas and be kept abreast of new technologies and opportunities. in the fall of 2012, faculty and non-library staff will be invited to join the group enabling researchers to find support among a group of like-minded scholars. by becoming more involved with the digital humanities, the library will be able to participate and support cross-departmental digital projects. we will be able to help manage projects and data and to assess the needs of the faculty. it is widely understood that with the boom of the internet, researchers are dealing with a large amount of data that can sometimes be overwhelming. the library has the expertise in both managing and discovering content that may not be widely available. furthermore, the library can point researchers to materials available at bc that may have been overlooked. the library will be able to facilitate scholars as they explore new ways of using technology. a digital humanities libguide is currently being created and will soon be available publicly. in the interim, librarians are attending training sessions, conferences, and are becoming well versed in relevant technologies. more importantly, by taking an active role, the libraries will be able to stay ahead of the technology curve and be able to recognize emerging trends and technologies in the field of dh. examples include the use of the tei (textual encoding initiative) in the classroom per the direction of professor laurie shepard (romance languages). the library was able to provide assistance with the tei, holding office hours, working with students and professor shepard and providing access to oxygen xml editing software. technology is dynamic. in order to succeed in dh, one must be open-minded, experimental, and willing to take a chance with a burgeoning project or specific program. the libraries are available to foster relationships, provide guidance, and most importantly, allow for experimentation within the field of digital humanities. lindsay skay whitacre assistant digital collections librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board .

(class of 1936) has left to the university. the late speaker of the united states house of representatives (known to his friends and colleagues as \"tip\") has had a library, a scholarship fund and an endowed faculty position named after him. he even donated his political papers to the boston college library. o'neill never forgot his alma mater and contributed his own time and energy to aid boston college in its development activities, helping to make the institution grow from a small liberal arts college into one of the nation's preeminent research and teaching universities. o'neill is pictured here in the procession line of the 1981 university commencement. he received the ignatian medal and was the keynote speaker that year. despite o'neill's many contributions both to boston college and the nation as a whole, his achievements are in danger of fading from popular memory. for instance, today's undergraduates are unlikely to remember o'neill in public office, as they were barely in elementary school when he retired from political life in 1986. years after his graduation from boston college, o'neill remained fond of his alma mater and his alma mater celebrated his achievements. this sentiment is evident in the photograph reproduced here. the image shows a sign at alumni stadium welcoming o'neill to the campus for the 1981 commencement. riding on the wave of excitement generated by the recent publication of john aloysius farrell's tip o'neill and the democratic century (boston: little, brown & co., 2001), this exhibit hopes to inform and remind people of o'neill's legacy as a boston college student and alumnus. the exhibit uses images and other materials found in the thomas p. o'neill papers and university archives housed in the burns library. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Thomas P.

are encouraged to check them out and interact with their technology. ipads allow for multiple ways to learn as well as innovative ways to engage and reach students. dr. katherine mcneill, associate professor in teacher education, uses ipads with her students. dr. mcneill states \u201ci teach ed 109.01- teaching about the natural world , which is a class for undergraduates majoring in elementary education. ed109.01 is unique in that it is taught at gardner elementary school in boston for eight of the fourteen weeks during the semester in conjunction with an afterschool program. the course provides undergraduates with experiences teaching science to elementary students that allow them to link theory to practice in engaging ways. this semester i worked with some of the undergraduates to integrate the ipads into their science lessons at gardner. this was the first time that i had observed elementary students using ipads in the classroom. as soon as the ipads were brought out, the elementary students were immediately engaged. the technology tool is exciting and new for the students, which they are interested in exploring.\u201d dr. lillie albert, associate professor in teacher education, is also working with the erc ipads in her classes. most of the lsoe students do not own an ipad but, thanks to the erc, students have access to the devices and can check them out of the library to experiment with the apps in an educational setting. in class, dr. albert challenges her students to think critically about the apps in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of using a particular app with students. she asks her students to look at the specific purpose behind an app as well as the overall directions supplied with an app. in addition, dr. albert questions her students by asking them to think about what they would suggest to the developer to change in a specific app. she also engages her students in a discussion about apps that are colorful and fun versus apps geared toward teaching students problem solving skills. moreover, another benefit that dr. albert sees with the new ipad technology is the distinct advantage over the printed text. in an ipad it is easy to highlight, underline, and write in the margins. reading articles, marking them up, and storing them is a whole lot easier with an ipad. to find out more about the current apps loaded on the

opportunity when i started working at the john j. burns library in 2009 i was secretly pleased that it is housed in a collegiate gothic style building that boasts a handsome tower. a tower is the symbol of saint barbara, my name saint. i felt certain that this was a good sign for me. for others a tower has different connotations, it means a citadel or fortress. this could imply a structure which is unwelcoming or unapproachable. famous towers, such as the tower of london, reinforce this impression\u2014being \u201csent to the tower\u201d was a situation which generally ended badly. the frightening impression that other towers may have is countered on the ford tower by the whimsical bas-relief figures embellishing the framework above the doorway. there you see shakespeare, dante, and diogenes playfully rendered. fittingly, you also see figures of students perusing books while displaying puzzled expressions as they earnestly strive to cull the meaning of the great authors\u2019 works. during the time i have worked at the library, many students have bravely entered the ford tower and have found the experience rewarding both for their current studies and future goals. i have had the pleasure of working directly with some of these outstanding students. in 2009, two seniors, meaghan ryan and mike pesce, received instruction from me. meaghan enjoyed working in both the conservation lab and the archive department, decided to become a library professional, and successfully applied to graduate school. mike stayed on the summer after graduation assisting me with a major project involving the care of 1,109 jesuit imprints. the project was finished on schedule, fortunately for me, because by summer\u2019s end the very capable mike was offered a paralegal position\u2014a step towards his goal to pursue a career in law. andrew kuhn, a graduate student, came to work with me in the academic year 2009-2010. it quickly became clear that, although he wished to learn from me, andrew himself had much to offer to the burns library. when my colleague, reference librarian justine sundaram, and i planned a seminar on the yeats sisters\u2019 cuala press, andrew was a perfect fit as a skilled speaker with impressive knowledge of letterpress printing. along with boston college professor marjorie howes and justine, he gave a well-received talk for the association of college and research libraries program. since then, andrew was the curator of the beautifully designed exhibit, painter, illustrator, author: irish art in the 20th century, shown in the burns library o\u2019brien fine print room. recently he wrote an entry for the burns library blog, see this link to read his informative article . by taking advantage of these library opportunities, andrew is building a scholarly reputation. the 2010-2011 academic year brought seniors lauren zajac and erin garrity to the conservation lab. erin was the book builders of boston intern and was a double major, history and english literature. while working in the lab, erin made clamshell boxes for a number of valuable books. she made use of the library for research, consulting the w.b. yeats collection for her history thesis and writing for the burns library blog . upon graduation erin was employed as an editorial assistant for pearson publishing, fulfilling her goal to work in the field of publication. lauren zajac chose to work in the lab as part of her senior honors project. lauren, like erin, was a double major; her topics chemistry and studio art. to further her dream of a career in chemistry, lauren conducted research with dr. gregory mcmahon in the bc clean room and assisted in the burns lab with the repair of watercolor paintings from the nuala n\u00ed dhomhnaill papers. last june lauren began work as a lab research assistant at new york university. catherine macek, our book builders of boston intern for this academic year, is a history major. she was a great help in my lab and, like lauren, conducted research with dr. gregory mcmahon in the bc clean room. her clean room project involved a brass book clasp from the mid-15th century, an item from the burns library collection. in addition, catherine went an extra mile; she wrote an excellent burns library blog entry about her project and gave a presentation for father jeremy clarke\u2019s class hs 300 study and writing of history: globalizing jesus. catherine will graduate this may and her burns library experience will be useful for her future employment. she will receive teacher training over the summer and then will be engaged in the \u201cteach for america\u201d program. the ford memorial tower is more than an attractive architectural feature on the boston college campus; it is a portal of opportunity for goal-oriented students. the archival collections and rare books offer inspiration for scholars of many disciplines. the interior of the tower will be renovated in the near future, providing a welcoming and accessible environment for students to pursue their current and future goals. barbara adams hebard john j. burns library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review

libraries newsletter volume 13 number 3 summer 2012 turning information oceans into streams in his recent book the information: a history, a theory, a flood , james gleick describes a familiar truth: technology has become so proficient in delivering information that it threatens to overwhelm our capacity to find meaning in it all. the phrase \u201ca flood of information\u201d is more than just a metaphor but a daily experience for many of us in academe. our academic training has helped to some extent by introducing us to strategies like relying on familiar publishers and journals or on the reputations of established scholars and researchers. we attend conferences and engage in conversations where our colleagues share their scholarship and research. but how do we get beyond the familiar sources to discover what else might be \u201cout there\u201d? fortunately, discovery tools are available which can serve as \u201cscouts\u201d for scholars venturing forth into unfamiliar territory. none are perfect, but they offer ways of learning about new and exciting developments in our fields. the library's web site has a page about signing up for alerting services , many of which will let you know via e-mail when articles, books, and other materials on the topics of interest have been published. you can specify which journals and databases can be set up to alert you, and target those you are familiar with. you can also use alerting services from interdisciplinary resources which have the potential of introducing you to unfamiliar journals and publishers. examples of such resources are web of science (which does have an arts & humanities component), refaware , and google scholar . this last tool has its flaws but shouldn't be dismissed outright; when used together with other tools, it can be quite useful. like many other universities and colleges, boston college has enabled find it links in google scholar, making it possible for bc users to retrieve full text articles if they are available in the search results. academic libraries around the world are developing another resource which can connect scholars to new material: the institutional repository. designed to make the research of an institution's scholars freely available on the web, a repository is becoming an important tool for sharing information outside the usual channels of traditional publishing. just as researchers are familiar with what book publishers and journals are more highly regarded in their discipline, they are also aware of what institutions are producing the more significant work in their field. periodically checking certain repositories may eventually become part of a scholar's regular workflow. an excellent starting point for exploring the repository world is this page created and maintained by sparc , an international alliance of academic and research libraries. some subject areas also have repositories that were created and are being managed by scholars. examples include repec which contains about 1.2 million articles and working papers in economics and related sciences, and arxiv which contains nearly 750,000 electronic preprints in physics, mathematics, computer

13 number 2 spring 2012 the libraries loan ipads, laptops, chargers \u2013 really? really!!! it\u2019s been about a year since several of the libraries began circulating laptops and ipads. soon after that, o\u2019neill added chargers for dell and mac laptops, graphing and mathematical calculators, head phones, flat screen adapters and flip cameras. why? the simple answer is student demand. tom wall, the university librarian, has an undergraduate student advisory group and they have been articulating technology needs for us for some time. o\u2019neill has a combination of 25 ipads and laptops to loan. the erc in campion also has ipads for loan (and many other technology items.). they have designated six ipads for general circulation and six that must be borrowed as a set with the intention of being used as a teaching tool in a classroom. ipads and laptops have a 4 day loan, while most other technology items circulate for 4 hours. you can check the availability of each by going to the libraries home page and clicking on technology loans or searching in quest using the title ipad. you can also check on what other technology items are available such as calculators or mac and laptop chargers. if you\u2019ve been on the fence about purchasing an ipad here\u2019s an opportunity to give the new technology an extended test drive. not so high tech, but also recommended by the students, is the o\u2019neill library popular reading collection currently shelved on level 1 of o\u2019neill near the campanella connection entrance. this is a rental collection of print books, mostly ordered from best seller lists. these books circulate for 28 days to faculty, staff and students. there is a basic collection of about 200 books that is refreshed every month or so. to complement this collection, the libraries very recently rolled out an e-book popular reading collection, hosted by overdrive. through this new service, you can download e-books onto devices such as kindles, ipads and smart phones. our initial collection contains best sellers, top academic picks, and thousands of e-books in the public domain. bc users can check out up to 2 titles at a time for 7, 14, or 21 days. access overdrive here, or click on the \"download ebooks\" link on the library homepage. what else can you find on o\u2019neill\u2019s level 1? a newly established rental collection of popular movies on dvd joined the books a few weeks ago. the collection will grow to about 60-70 dvds and be refreshed as the books are. the loan period for the dvds is 4 days. you can place a hold on the items in this collection so that you will be notified when the one you want is returned. you can make recommendations for any of the popular collections in o\u2019neill by sending your suggestions to pop.reading@bc.edu . if you have any other recommendations about how bc libraries could serve users\u2019 technology needs, please contact me at margie.battaglia@bc.edu . margie battaglia head,

volume 13 number 2 spring 2012 like conversations with scholars and librarians before the advent of the world wide web, researchers often relied on print bibliographies for identifying important material in their research areas. these bibliographies came in all sizes: short citation lists appended to encyclopedia entries and journal articles, longer lists in monographs, and exhaustive lists such as published single volumes and multi-volume sets of books devoted entirely to bibliographies. today, publishers of electronic reference works, journals, and books have made these bibliographies available on the web. moreover, some types of works, for example many online reference works, are periodically revised, and consequently their bibliographies can include more current titles. a major new online bibliographic tool has appeared recently: oxford bibliographies online (obo). produced by oxford university press, it consists of a growing number of subject bibliography modules , each module with an editor and a group of scholarly contributors. users of obo will benefit from the expertise of scholars considered experts in the bibliography\u2019s topic. given the enormous increase in the amount of information being published every year, it has become more and more challenging to identify that material considered to be the most significant. this challenge means that a resource like obo can be a welcome addition to a scholar\u2019s repertoire of research tools. designed to be useful for people at all levels of academic experience, each subject module with its editorial preface and annotated citations introduces undergraduates to research in the area as well as alerts more advanced researchers to significant material. the boston college libraries have thus far acquired four subject modules. each has one or more boston college faculty members contributing to the bibliography. the modules with boston college contributors are: atlantic history : david northrup (history department) biblical studies : christopher matthews, daniel j. harrington, thomas d. stegman (all three from the school of theology and ministry) islamic studies : natana delong-bas (theology department) medieval studies : robin fleming (history department) in order to enhance each bibliography\u2019s usefulness, many of the citations have links to quest records and in some cases to full text. the citations along with the annotations can be exported to any one of five citation management tools including endnote, refworks, and zotero. the range of topics covered within each subject module is extensive; for example, the biblical studies module includes bibliographies for topics you would expect to be covered (e.g., specific books of the bible) but some you might not, for example \u201crhetoric in the new testament\u201d and \u201ccourt tales\u201d (forthcoming). reflecting the dynamic nature of research, bibliographies will be periodically updated. like many publishers eager to attract customers, oxford university includes links on its obo website to favorable comments by scholars and reviewers, for example the following excerpt of a review from the new yorker : one of the things i like best about o.b.o. is that, unlike wiki or other anonymously crowdsourced outlets, the individual personalities of the authors shine through. a few weeks ago, i attended the launch party for the project, which confirmed that the whole endeavor was done with a mind toward what might be called humanness. i learned that the idea was hatched in a british pub, and that there had been, since the beginning, plenty of old-fashioned academic squabbling over what to include in the entries (which can be added to and updated, through a vetting process). at the party and, later, reading through the bibliography online, i felt like i'd enjoyed a series of conversations with trusted professors and really good librarians. please feel free to contact a subject librarian if you have any questions about this resource or would like to recommend acquisition of any of the modules. jonas barciauskas head of collection development o\u2019neill library questions, comments? contact

(metadata services), sarah hogan (government documents-research and engagement services), leslie homzie (government documents-research and engagement services), and betsy mckelvey (digital

http://www.hathitrust.org/ ), an archive of over 10 million digitized items with over 2.7 in the public domain, has enabled us to harvest and provide electronic access to a large percentage of historical government documents. these documents are accessible through holmes , our online catalog. as part of this process we have been offering-up the print holdings for withdrawal, in accordance with federal depository library program policies, to the boston public library (a comprehensive depository library), and other new england academic libraries. our enhanced electronic collection, and streamlined print collection, the majority of which will be moved offsite, will provide space for the upcoming level one renovations. these renovations will accommodate the growing demand for

boston college ever to excel thomas p. o'neill, jr. and boston college virtual exhibit spring 2002 - burns library introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion throughout the years, boston college has recognized the achievements of thomas p. o'neill, jr. the university bestowed upon o'neill numerous awards and honors. his legacy lives on to this day. a library, an endowed position in the political science department, a scholarship and an award for distinguished citizenship all bear his name. this section highlights several of these honors. on may 13, 1964, o'neill was honored as the year's outstanding alumnus by the boston college alumni club of washington, d.c. president reverend michael p. walsh, s.j. is shown here presenting the award to o'neill. the congressman had also received the alumni association's william v. mckenna medal earlier that year. photo credit: university archives, burns library, boston college at the 1973 university commencement, o'neill received an honorary law degree. he is shown here at the ceremonies standing next to father monan. in the late 1930s, while a state representative, o'neill had enrolled in the boston college law school. however, the pressures of simultaneously going to school and being an elected official left very little time for serious study. according to o'neill biographer farrell, he and follow state legislator edward boland were both \"booted out\" of the law school when the dean decided to raise the academic standards. the incident bothered o'neill for years to come. receiving an honorary law degree must have given him a sense of vindication. photo credit: university archives, burns library, boston college on december 9, 1979, boston college held a birthday dinner fundraiser to raise 1.2 million dollars for the thomas p. o'neill, jr. endowed chair in political science. it was o'neill's sixty-seventh birthday. besides o'neill, the main guest of honor was president jimmy carter. as evident in the photograph to the left, the speaker had a friendly relationship with the president. after all, carter was the only democratic party president that he ever worked with while serving in the house leadership (majority whip, majority leader, speaker). carter's presence gave quite a boost to this fundraising event. president carter, j. peter grace, edward kennedy, and j. donald monan, s.j. gave tributes to the speaker. o'neill always held educators in high regard. he once remarked that \"educators have a premier responsibility to help our young people ponder whether their individual actions will benefit their family and friends, and urge them to be concerned about improving their neighborhood, their community, their nation, and their world.\" an endowed chair named in his honor is a fitting living monument to a man who held education in such high regard. photo credit: thomas p. o'neill papers, burns library, boston college o'neill was the keynote speaker for the 1981 commencement. he also received the ignatius medal as part of the ceremonies. the speaker is shown here receiving the medal from president father monan. the award recognizes individuals whose lives reflect the contributions made by st. ignatius loyola to catholic spirituality and education and who apply these values to modern professional life. in his commencement address, o'neill was well aware of the significance of this award and remarked: \"i am truly honored to receive this medal from my alma mater because i genuinely appreciate what jesuit expectations are in the religious as well as the secular life. this is a very special honor.\" the undergraduate government of boston college also presented o'neill with a reward recognizing \"his consistent and effective efforts to open roads for government to play a part in assisting students to carry out their aspirations for higher education.\" photo credit: jet photography, university archives, burns library, boston college groundbreaking and construction work began on the thomas p. o'neill jr. library on october 18 1981. on october 14, 1984, the library was dedicated with o'neill in attendance. the photograph here shows o'neill and the other dignitaries present at the dedication. o'neill commented that he had \"declined many offers to name buildings after me...but this time i made an exception because this college has meant so much to me, to my family, to my community. i am proud of its past and i am proud to pay a part in its future.\" most students, staff and faculty will use the library at some point in their careers at boston college and, by doing so, they will encounter the legacy of thomas p. o'neill, jr. photo credit: office of communications, university archives, burns library, boston college from 1987 to1996, boston college recreated the speaker's office in the bapst library. the original exhibit is pictured here. the room had originally housed the library director's office (and presently houses the university chancellor's office). on loan from the government was a desk used by president grover cleveland (used by o'neill in his washington office), a grandfather clock, curtains, two chandeliers, a sofa, a love seat, chairs, tables, lamps and a porcelain horse sculpture given to the speaker by the premier of china. in 1999, the exhibit

is pictured here with the o'neill scholarship recipients in may 1990. it is a fitting legacy to have this scholarship named after him. in 1986, o'neill remarked that \"yet even today there is a need to ensure that boston college remains true to its long tradition of educating the sons and daughters of the working class...pursuing a degree at boston college takes more than time and talent, it takes a lot of money...even with federal and state assistance many young people cannot afford the cost of four years of study. at boston college, the thomas p. o'neill, jr. scholarship fund will solve that problem for some deserving but financially disadvantaged youths. hopefully, it will also help guarantee that a proud tradition of boston college's past will be a continuing part of boston college's future.\" to this day, students from o'neill's congressional district receive this scholarship and are able to attend boston college. photo credit: gary gilbert, thomas p. o'neill papers,

and we ask your continuous blessing on him and upon this revered body that he loves so dearly. amen.\" the tone was set for the evening's later celebration. later that day, 2300 people attended a $1000-per-plate gala reception in honor of o'neill's fifty years of public service hosted by boston college at the washington hilton. in a detail of a photograph, o'neill is pictured at the event surrounded by happy friends and colleagues. o'neill was given tributes by j. donald monan, s.j., senator ted kennedy, irish prime minister garret fitzgerald, comedian bob hope, former president gerald ford and president ronald reagan. monan remarked that \"speaker o'neill could have authorized a salute to his years in a dozen ways without any involvement of boston college. the fact that he wanted much of the splendor of his own career to reflect upon his alma mater is characteristic of him, and gives a clue to why people so enjoyed celebrating his career.\" the event raised two million dollars for the thomas p. o'neill, jr. scholarship fund. the scholarship is designed to aid less advantaged youths in the boston area who without financial assistance could not otherwise attend boston college. in may 1986, thomas o'neill returned to boston college to take part in the class of 1936's fiftieth anniversary. in the photograph on the left, o'neill is seen joyfully taking in the reunion festivities along with father monan, an unidentified alum, alumni association president sheila mcgovern, and classmate robert o'hayre. in 1987, o'neill honored his alma mater even further by donating his congressional papers to boston college's john j. burns library of rare books and special collections. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Alumnus", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "Thomas P.

boston college ever to excel thomas p. o'neill, jr. and boston college virtual exhibit spring 2002 - burns library introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion thomas p. o'neill learned two great lessons from his first campaign. one lesson was learned on the last day of the campaign from his high school elocution and drama teacher, a neighbor who lived across the street from his residence. on that fateful day, mrs. elizabeth o'brien approached the aspiring politician and said \"tom, i'm going to vote for you tomorrow even though you didn't ask me.\" o'neill was puzzled as he had known mrs. o'brien for years and had done chores for her, cutting grass, raking leaves and shoveling snow. he told his neighbor that \"i didn't think i had to ask for your vote.\" she replied \"tom, let me tell you something: people like to be asked.\" the second bit of advice came a few days after the election from o'neill's father. during the election, thomas o'neill, sr., removed himself from his son's first election and left him to his own devices. however, after the election, he told tip: \"let me tell you something that i learned years ago. all politics is local.\" during the campaign, tip took his neighborhood for granted and did not work hard enough in his \"own backyard.\" o'neill took these lessons to heart. he would not hold his career aspirations over the interests of his constituents. the advice paid off: o'neill served for fifty years in public office (sixteen years in the massachusetts house of representations and thirty-four years in the united states house of representatives). in 1937, o'neill began his first year of public life as a massachusetts state representative. he ran on bread and butter issues: more jobs and decent wages. o'neill pursued wpa funds for the creation of local jobs to cleanup the polluted charles river and alewife brook. in that same year, he took an unpopular stand and voted to repeal an american legion-backed loyalty oath that would have been required of all educators (including college professors). o'neill felt that the oath cast doubts upon the patriotism of educators and was \"an insult to some of the finest men and women i had ever known.\" though the american legion vowed to defeat o'neill in his next election, o'neill explained his position to his constituents and was reelected to a second term. his stand established him as an independent-minded legislator. his hard work and integrity continued to get him reelected. o'neill also earned the respect of his follow democratic representatives and was elected minority leader in 1947 by his peers. the above is an image of a campaign card used in o'neill's 1940 campaign. in 1948, u.s. congressman john mccormack (democratic party whip and leader of the massachusetts delegation) offered his support and encouraged o'neill to campaign hard to make the democratic party the majority party in the massachusetts house of representatives for the first time in a century. their effort paid off as they captured 38 out of 40 gop districts targeted by the democratic strategy. the democrats now held a majority of the seats (122 to 118). o'neill became the speaker of the massachusetts house of representatives. in 1952, congressman john f. kennedy ran for u.s. senate and this left his congressional seat open. o'neill decided to run, and won the election by a three thousand vote margin. in 1952, o'neill was riding against the political current as the republicans gained ground on the democratic party across the country. adlai stevenson was defeated by general dwight eisenhower in the race for the white house and the republicans captured congress. o'neill had gone from the massachusetts house speakership (one of the most powerful government positions in massachusetts) to being a freshman congressman of the minority party. he is pictured here arriving at the capitol with his friend and colleague congressman edward boland (bc class of 1926). for twenty years, boland and o'neill shared an apartment in washington, d.c. thomas o'neill did not take any vote for granted. he is pictured to the left at the ballot box with his wife mildred ann (miller) o'neill in the mid 1950s. not forgetting the advice of mrs. o'brien, on every election, he would ask millie for her vote. she would typically reply \"tom, i'll give you every consideration.\" mildred miller and o'neill had been married in 1941 at st. john's church in north cambridge. over the years, o'neill always stated how grateful he was for all of the support that millie gave him and their family of five children. in 1938, o'neill supplemented his salary by establishing a local real estate business and would stay in business until 1971. unlike other congressmen's families, o'neill's family stayed in cambridge while o'neill was in washington. he returned home to his family on weekends. listing all of o'neill's accomplishments in congress would be a daunting task and space only allows the listing a few highlights. in 1955, he became a member of the influential house rules committee. it was just one of the many committees that o'neill served on during his years in congress. in 1958, o'neill and edward boland introduced legislation that lead to the establishment of the cape cod national seashore. in 1970, he was a co-sponsor of a reform bill that ended the practice of unrecorded voting in the house. congressmen would now be accountable to their constituents for their actions. in 1971, o'neill became the majority whip and was now part of the house leadership. two years later, he became the majority leader. the majority leader is shown here (right) serving on a congressional committee in a photograph taken by house photographer dev o'neill (no relation to tip) in 1973. in 1974, o'neill played a key role in managing the nixon impeachment proceedings. in 1977, o'neill became the speaker of the house of representatives. he held the position until 1987. this was the longest continuous term of the speakership in the nation's history. one of his most important actions in congress was to open the house to live television coverage (cspan) beginning in 1979. in the 1980s, o'neill spearheaded the democrats' efforts to hold the excesses of the reagan revolution in check and to prevent massive scale backs of social programs for the nation's aged and less advantaged citizens. the speaker felt reagan did not have a firm grasp on domestic affairs and once characterized the popular president as a \"herbert hoover with a smile.\" for these efforts, o'neill was vilified as a \"tax and spend liberal\" by the republicans, the conservative press and even some of his own constituents. also to the displeasure of the reagan administration, he was horrified by the atrocities committed by contra rebels in nicaragua and sought to limit u.s. funding to these groups. o'neill did not run for reelection in 1986 and retired from public office in january 1987. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Speaker", "refURL":

there were only 2649 full and part-time students enrolled in 1935-1936 school year. in a 1991 interview, o'neill recalled that \"the school was small, and everybody knew each other...everything was walk-on, you know, there were no dorms. actually, we were only in three buildings. st. mary's hall was the chapel...everyone loved it-it was small, it was intimate, it was chummy.\" o'neill faced a challenging and rigorous education (a classical curriculum with required coursework in greek, latin, mathematics, history, english, and theology that left little room for electives). however, he found time for extracurricular activities and was a member of the sodality, von pastor historical society, and the law academy. during his senior year, o'neill was elected sergeant at arms of this organization. he also rowed and captained the crew team and was a member of the fencing team. o'neill's most significant extracurricular activity took place outside of the classroom: he ran for a seat on the cambridge city council. of the forty-eight candidates running for eight seats, o'neill finished ninth, not bad for a college senior. it was the only election that he ever lost. football was a big part of boston college life during the thirties and fordham university was the team to beat. in 1933 and 1935, o'neill's sophomore and senior years, boston college students traveled to new york in great numbers to watch the contest. o'neill and his buddies drove to new york in his old ford convertible. alas, boston college lost 32 to 6. however, the boys had fun throwing water bags out of their hotel in times square until the hotel detective ordered them to stop or be kicked out. his senior yearbook reported that the 1933 fordham trip was the \"most memorable incident in o'neill's college career\" and \"he was one of the most prominent (vociferously) members of the boston college club of cambridge.\" in 1935, o'neill and his friends again journeyed to new york city. the excitement of the game is captured in a detail of the heights (the boston college student paper) to the left. alas, boston college lost again; this time the score was 19 to 0. the postgame hi-jinks of 1933 graduated to the more sophisticated activity of listening to the eddy duchin orchestra at the plaza hotel. thomas o'neill and two hundred forty-eight other undergraduates finished the necessary requirements and graduated on wednesday, june 10, 1936 at four o'clock in the afternoon. the cover of his commencement program is reproduced to the left. the hon. michael macwhite, ireland's \"envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\" gave the keynote address and was awarded a honorary doctor of laws. his senior class voted o'neill \"class politician\" and \"class caveman.\" the yearbook reported that he planned to \"keep active in politics until he is mayor of cambridge.\" the editors also noted that o'neill was barely defeated in his election and he was \"more confident of success in the next.\" little did they know, the next election was just around the corner. photo credits: university archives, burns library, boston college introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Student", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Thomas P.

(1874-1953), was a mason and spent much of his life involved with local city politics. o'neill, sr. was also active with the local democratic party, his union, the cambridge elks lodge and the knights of columbus. tip's mother, rose, died while he was still an infant. on her deathbed, rose made her husband vow to keep the family together and not divide children up among different aunts and uncles. tip, his older brother william and his sister mary rose were watched over by rose le blanc, the family's french-canadian housekeeper, extended family members and the dominican nuns of the local st. john convent. tip's father moved the family from fairfield street to a two-family house located at 74 orchard street. the building is pictured here in a photograph taken in 1973. it was a nicer neighborhood and the house was comfortable. the o'neill family occupied the top two floors and rented out the first level. o'neill biographer john farrell described the community as having the feeling of a \"small prosperous midwestern city during the 1920s\" with a \"wide central avenue, tree-lined streets and a sampling of handsome architecture.\" in his autobiography, tip o'neill described his community as \"relatively well off by working-class standards, but you didn't have to go far to find pockets of real poverty.\" 74 orchard remained his official residence until his marriage to mildred miller in 1941. they remained in the neighborhood, moving to nearby 16 norris street. the three milestones of o'neill's catholic boyhood, as indicated by farrell, were first communion, confirmation and moving from st. john's grammar school into st. john's high school in cambridge. the high school is pictured here in a photograph taken in 1980. in his autobiography, o'neill admitted that he wasn't the greatest student. however, a nun recalled his ability on the debate team and said that he could \"talk you deaf, dumb and blind.\" he was a likeable fellow who occasionally played hooky. the yearbook made the following comment of o'neill: \"never worried, never vexed, in one day and out the next.\" much of his time was spent with the \"barry's corner gang\" of friends. his pals rented space from \"old man barry\" and essentially had a private clubhouse. many of the gang would remain lifelong friends, and still held reunions into the 1980s. o'neill spent much of youthful leisure time playing and watching athletics. he enjoyed playing baseball, football, golf and basketball, and earned money as a caddy at the arlmont country club. in high school, o'neill was the captain of the basketball team during his senior year. in the photograph of this team, o'neill is seated in the middle of the center row. sports provided the source of his well known nickname, \"tip.\" the first \"tip o'neill\" was james edward o'neill, one of baseball's greatest batters, who played with the st. louis browns in the 1880's. he earned the nickname \"tip\" because of an uncanny ability to foul off pitches until he drew a walk or a soft throw from a pitcher. many boys had the nickname \"tip.\" both o'neill brothers as children had \"tip\" as a nickname. originally, bill was known as \"tip\" and tom as \"little tip.\" however, the name stuck with tom throughout his life. photo credits: r. cheek photograph. cambridge historical commission office of communications, university archives, burns library, boston college thomas p. o'neill papers, burns library, boston college introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Background", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "Faculty Publication Highlights", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/sites/libraries/facpub/", "text": "faculty publication highlights current highlight selected articles on immigration peter skerry view interview and more \u00bb the faculty publication highlights series features recent publications by boston college faculty. while it is likely that monographs will figure largely among these publications, the libraries are also eager to promote other faculty productions such as significant journal articles, paintings, musical compositions, and movies. if you have any comments or suggestions for future highlights, please contact brendan rapple , collection development librarian or nina bogdanovsky , reference & collection development librarian. view all highlights \u00bb \u00a9 2014 boston college | boston college libraries | contact | archives | subscribe", "hrefTitle": "Faculty Publication Highlights", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2012summer/info/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Kinesiology and Sports"], "title": "University Libraries -

burns library introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion today it would be hard to be a member of the boston college community and not come into contact with some element of the legacy that thomas p. o'neill, jr. (class of 1936) has left to the university. the late speaker of the united states house of representatives (known to his friends and colleagues as \"tip\") has had a library, a scholarship fund and an endowed faculty position named after him. he even donated his political papers to the boston college library. o'neill never forgot his alma mater and contributed his own time and energy to aid boston college in its development activities, helping to make the institution grow from a small liberal arts college into one of the nation's preeminent research and teaching universities. o'neill is pictured here in the procession line of the 1981 university commencement. he received the ignatian medal and was the keynote speaker that year. despite o'neill's many contributions both to boston college and the nation as a whole, his achievements are in danger of fading from popular memory. for instance, today's undergraduates are unlikely to remember o'neill in public office, as they were barely in elementary school when he retired from political life in 1986. years after his graduation from boston college, o'neill remained fond of his alma mater and his alma mater celebrated his achievements. this sentiment is evident in the photograph reproduced here. the image shows a sign at alumni stadium welcoming o'neill to the campus for the 1981 commencement. riding on the wave of excitement generated by the recent publication of john aloysius farrell's tip o'neill and the democratic century (boston: little, brown & co., 2001), this exhibit hopes to inform and remind people of o'neill's legacy as a boston college student and alumnus. the exhibit uses images and other materials found in the thomas p. o'neill papers and university archives housed in the burns library. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Thomas P.

burns library intro | original novels | short stories/folklore | british authors | irish writers | american & european writers | conclusion the irish free state established by the anglo-irish treaty (1921) following the war of independence (1919-1921) pursued a project of cultural nationalism which among other aims focused on reviving the irish language. the cumann na ngaedheal government established an g\u00fam , the publications branch of the department of education (later oifig an tsol\u00e1thair/the state publishing agency) in 1925-1926 to supply textbooks and fiction in irish for the educational and recreation needs of the newly independent ireland. an g\u00fam , to fulfil its publishing mandate, cultivated both original authors and translators. in addition to organizing literary competitions for original novels, plays and short stories in irish such as m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 siochfhradha's collection of short stories soineann's doineann , it commissioned translations of european and american authors, such as iain \u00e1luinn , a 1931 translation of neil munro's novel of the scottish highlands john splendid (1898). in addition to rendering foreign authors in irish, an g\u00fam also translated english language texts by irish authors such as m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 flainn's translation of d\u00f3mhnaill \u00f3 corcordha/daniel corkery's the threshold of quiet in 1931 as log an chi\u00fainis . the aims of this display are to preserve these covers, to make them available to a wider audience, and to celebrate the achievements of an g\u00fam ireland: art into history , dublin, town house, 1994). in an effort to expand our understanding of the free state, this virtual exhibition displays dust jackets that accompanied an g\u00fam publications and reclaims this \"lost\" art. this exhibit consists of an g\u00fam covers recently acquired by the john j. burns library of boston college as a gift from john w. o'gorman (class of 1953). the o'gorman gift includes the library of the goody glover gaelic society library that promoted irish language and dancing in boston in the 1950s and conducted classes at a private house in joy street on beacon hill. the dust jackets displayed here are from the irish collection of the burns library and from private collections in the boston area. prepared by brian \u00f3 conchubhair. acknowledgements: philip o'leary, mike cronin, david horn, ed copenhagen, ross shanley-roberts, shelley barber and mark esser. title: iain \u00e1luinn (beautiful ian) translator: se\u00e1n t\u00f3ib\u00edn (1887-1971) published: 1936 author: neil munro (1863-1928) original title: john splendid (1898) artwork: a\u00f3m source: john j. burns library title: log an chi\u00fainis (the place of quietness) translator: m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 flainn published: 1931 author: d\u00f3mhnaill \u00f3 corcordha/daniel corkery (1878-1964) original title: the threshold of quiet (1917) artwork: olive cunningham source: john j. burns library comment: the roman font on the cover appears to have prescribed the use of the diacritic marker on the dust jacket. note also the spelling of the author's name on the dust jacket as \"o' corcora,\" but as \"\u00f3 corcordha\" on the title page. title: soineann's doineann (fair and inclement weather) published: 1953 author: miche\u00e1l \u00f3 siochfhradha (1900-1986) artwork : h.e.l. source: private collection comment: miche\u00e1l \u00f3 siochfhradha, brother of p\u00e1draig [\"an seabhac\"] trained as a teacher before becoming an inspector and retired as chief inspector in 1965. he was a founding member of an comhar dr\u00e1ma\u00edochta theatre company, and edited two irish dictionaries. intro | original novels | short stories/folklore | british authors | irish writers | american & european writers | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Free State Art:Judging Ireland By Its Book Covers", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "Boston College Eagle -

burns library the boston college eagle: origins and development of the university mascot introduction: importance of a mascot though use of mascots goes back to ancient history, the word \"mascot\" did not come into usage in the english language until the late 19th century. a french composer named edmond audran (1842-1901) wrote a popular operetta entitled \"la mascotte\" (1880). it was quickly translated in english and performed in london in 1881 and in boston in 1882. the plot was very light-hearted fare concerning a rural girl who brought good luck to whoever possessed her, provided that she remained uncorrupted. the term, translated into english as \"mascot\" and used as a noun, has a notion of a person, animal or thing that brings good luck. it quickly became employed by sports teams. besides serving as a good luck charm, a mascot also provides a school with an added sense of identity. in 1889, yale university became the first american university to adopt a mascot, a bulldog named \"handsome dan.\" prior to 1921, boston college did not have an official mascot. between 1905-1910, the student body began voicing the desirability of having a mascot. briefly, they toyed with the idea of using the owl as mascot, but this never caught on. 1920 was a year of great success for the track team and certain students suggested the antelope. however, the enthusiasm for this choice soon lagged as well. then, as goes the college lore, a certain \"old man\" suggested the eagle and the rest is history. this online exhibit looks at the efforts to establish the eagle as the boston college mascot. it includes different artistic interpretations, as well as the eagle's continuing role and use in university life. used with the permission of the howard gotlieb archival research center at boston university. in this photograph dated january 12, 1977, longtime athletic director william j. flynn (1939; m.ed.,1940) paints the university logo, which includes an image of the eagle, onto the gymnasium floor, a most prominent location. introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion next \u00bb", "hrefTitle": "The Boston College Eagle:Origins And Development Of The University Mascot", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual.html"}, {"classification": ["Social Sciences", "Education"], "title": "Boston College Libraries Newsletter", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2012spring/answers/index.html", "text": "boston college libraries newsletter volume 13 number 2 spring 2012 answers@bc: instant answers to common questions from the boston college libraries do you have a question about library services at boston college? where can i find scanners? can i print to the library printers from my laptop? a book i really need is checked out. how can i get a copy? are there color printers in the library? how many books can i have checked out at once? how do i put things on reserve for my students? get instant answers from answers@bc. type a question or some keywords into the ask us! search box on the libraries home page or at answers.bc.edu to find an answer in our faqs. answers@bc is a smart system that will link you to answers matching key terms in your question\u2014sometimes even before you finish typing it. the ask us! box on the boston college libraries home page connects students, faculty, staff, and visitors to frequently asked questions about library services. if you don\u2019t find the information you need, you\u2019ll be able to submit your question and get an answer by e-mail from library staff.

libraries newsletter volume 13 number 2 spring 2012 the pamela frankau papers in burns library the burns library holds a sizable collection of the pamela frankau papers -- 3.25 linear feet and consisting of ten boxes ( click for finding aid ). the collection is mainly composed of correspondence, a typed short story, biographical material and the hand-written manuscripts of eight novels as well as that of frankau\u2019s 1961 pen to paper , her views on writing and her advice to aspiring authors. particularly interesting is an unpublished 10 page typed introduction by rebecca west to frankau\u2019s novel colonel blessington that was left unfinished at frankau\u2019s death. this introduction provides a fascinating account by west, who had a somewhat erratic friendship with frankau for many years, of frankau\u2019s life, her novels, her views on love, her adopted and staunch catholicism, her sexuality, among other topics. the titles of the eight novels in manuscript, heavily corrected and revised, are 1) shaken in the wind , 1948; the winged horse , 1953; a wreath for the enemy , 1954; ask me no more , 1958; road through the woods , 1960; sing for your supper , 1963; slaves of the lamp , 1965; over the mountains, 1967. pamela frankau, born in london in 1908, was jewish on her father\u2019s side. her family was a literary one. her father was the novelist gilbert frankau. her paternal grandmother, julia frankau (pseudonym frank danby), also wrote novels, the best known being pigs in clover . her grandaunt was the journalist mrs. aria. pamela was prolific from a young age. she produced her well received first novel, the marriage of harlequin , in 1927 at the age of nineteen. by twenty-three she had published five novels and two books of short stories. by thirty the number of her novels was up to twenty. pamela spent some time as a journalist, being a feature writer for the mirror and the daily sketch . during the second world war she worked in the ministry of food and then served in the auxiliary territorial service. she had an affair with the married poet humbert wolfe, arguably the love of her life, who died in 1940. though she had been raised an anglican by her jewish father, she converted to catholicism in her mid-thirties, in 1942. it is interesting that her father, shortly before his death in 1952, and his third wife also became catholics. rebecca west in her unpublished typescript in burns stresses the significance of pamela\u2019s adoption of catholicism: \u201c[her] conversion which was an astounding act of faith, of persistence in believing that, in spite of everything, the universe had a beneficent explanation. for to pamela \u2018everything\u2019 included much that might have been taken as evidence to the contrary. her only child died in infancy, the man she most loved and her two closest women friends died prematurely, and she herself was in ill-health for some long time before she died.\u201d after humbert wolfe\u2019s death, frankau spent much time in the united states. in 1945 she married marshall dill. a year later she gave birth to a son who died in infancy. the marriage was dissolved in 1951. frankau wrote little during the 1940s. however, in 1949 she published the willow cabin , probably her most successful and popular novel. in the 1950s she had a long relationship with margaret webster, a theatrical director. on 8 june, 1967 frankau died of breast cancer. she is buried in hampstead cemetery, london. in her obituary of frankau in the times rebecca west while observing that some of her novels are compared to those of galsworthy was herself somewhat cool to them: \u201cnone of her novels, though they are better than most, was as good as she was\u201d. still, in her day many of frankau\u2019s novels sold very well. some received high critical acclaim. no\u00ebl coward wrote highly of her 1958 novel ask me no more . compton mackenzie praised the passion of her writing. of frankau\u2019s road through the woods isabelle mallet wrote: \u201cmiss frankau has written a tightly knit novel, with fine characterizations and moments of real beauty.\u201d (new york times, 22 jan., 1961). ann schakne in 1949 observed that in the willow cabin frankau \u201cachieved a remarkable fusion of wit, character and craftsmanship. ... it has precision of phrase, unobtrusive economy of style and genuine passion; she has handled her difficult plot extremely well. ... \u2018the willow cabin\u2019 is an outstanding novel.\u201d (new york times, 21 aug, 1949). leanne zugsmith described her 1935 novel fly now, falcon as \u201calmost constantly entertaining\u201d (new york times, 11 aug., 1935). orville prescott was frankau\u2019s greatest champion. in a 1958 review of ask me no more he writes that \u201c ... no one, i am convinced, could read this book without admiration for miss frankau\u2019s dazzling skill. no woman now writing novels has a greater command of the craft of fiction. ... but she has not yet received the literary recognition she deserves. in an era such as ours, when inept, clumsy and pretentiously muddled novels are acclaimed, it is all the more regrettable that an accomplished novelist with a personal vision of life and love like miss frankau is not taken more seriously. after all, she is just as clever as evelyn waugh and a lot more emotionally powerful\u201d (new york times, 10 nov, 1958). though virago has reprinted several of frankau\u2019s novels in recent years, she no longer receives much attention from readers and even less from modern critics. this is odd as a strong case can be made that she is entitled to the same critical stature as some other twentieth century female writers such as mary renault, naomi mitchison, rosamund lehmann, stella gibbons. as elizabeth maslen observed in her 2001 book political and social issues in british women's fiction, 1928-1968 : \u201cthe considerable contemporary critical acclaim which consistently greeted the publication of works by storm jameson, phyllis bottome, pamela frankau, and susan ertz, to name only a few, invites investigation as to why so few, if any, of their works are still remembered.\u201d at any rate, if any bc student, or perhaps faculty member, is looking for an under-researched literary figure for a term paper, thesis, dissertation, journal article or indeed monograph topic, pamela frankau, her life and writings, are certainly worthy of consideration. and an excellent start would be to wander over to burns library and consult the frankau papers! brendan rapple collection development, o\u2019neill library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston college libraries",

2012 increasing knowledge of and access to special collections bridget burke joined the bc libraries as associate university librarian for special collections in october 2011. bridget has held curatorial positions at yale university and the colorado historical society, and has directed special collections at george mason university and the university of alaska fairbanks. she holds a ba (english) and mls from the university of wisconsin madison, and an ma in liberal studies / history from wesleyan university. she has published on the history of labor in the printing trades, labor journalism, and the education of women for librarianship. what's so special about special collections? as a member of the association of research libraries (arl), boston college libraries is one of over one hundred peer institutions committed to building research-quality collections, and one of dozens such libraries in the boston area. within the arl community a consensus about the role of special collections in a research library has emerged: special collections are in fact what distinguish any library \u2013 this library -- from its peers. as noted in a 2009 arl report : \"in an environment where mass digitization of books and periodicals ... is accelerating ... it is their accumulated special collections that increasingly define the uniqueness and character of individual research libraries.\u201d and it is the character of the institution that shapes the collections that become defined as \"special.\u201d the strengths of special collections in the burns library at bc reflect its history as a school founded to educate the children of irish immigrants, a jesuit college, and a boston institution. at the same time, our collections change and grow as new areas of interest and opportunity emerge. examples include popular culture (the kane collection of over 13,000 comic books), urban planning (the jane jacobs collection), and northern ireland (pamphlets secured from belfast\u2019s linen hall library). what next? our engagement with the bc community (you!) guarantees that our collections will continue to grow, reflecting the interest and support of faculty, staff, students, alumni, and our international partners. what now? the bc libraries and burns library staff are engaged in a number of new initiatives to increase knowledge of and access to special collections: 1. increasing discovery \u2014 both mechanistic (type it, find it) and experiential (exposing students to materials that prompt \"aha!\u201d moments). the burns library hosted 18 classes and almost 300 students this fall, sharing with undergraduates materials ranging from 19th century correspondence between an irish immigrant and his sweetheart, to contemporary comic books and early scientific books. a \"processing blitz\u201d begins this spring, with funding for one year and the goal of organizing and describing unprocessed manuscript collections. to promote use, a working group of subject liaisons is creating models to integrate special collections into library instruction across the curriculum. we will continue to work collaboratively with faculty to support their teaching and promote student discovery of our collections. 2. integrating content \u2013 instruction, exhibits, and digital projects all generate content from burns collections. how can this content be better integrated so that it exists in multiple platforms, digital and physical, performed and archived? can we promote a distributed model of content generation that involves library staff but also taps students, faculty, and others in creating blog postings, curating exhibits, and helping queue collections for digitization? as one example, the burns library blog is broad in its scope and authorship; is this a model for exhibits? this spring, watch for new cases in the o\u2019neill library that will feature burns library material and will serve as a laboratory for different models of curation and content integration. 3. celebrating bc\u2019s sesquicentennial - university archives are at the core of bc\u2019s special collections; after all, the responsibility to collect and preserve bc\u2019s history is ours and ours alone. bc libraries will celebrate bc\u2019s sesquicentennial in a number of ways: we are creating physical and online exhibits that draw on special collections, and populating a digital archive of bc publications ( sub turri and the heights ). in addition, burns collections will support programs and publications generated by many campus departments. special is as special does, and the year ahead offers ample opportunity to build on our traditional strengths while experimenting with new models of description, delivery, and curation. i look forward to getting to know the bc community and to sharing with you all the passion of the burns library staff for the collections we hold and the history we keep. bridget j. burke associate university librarian for

it\u2019s hard to believe it, but march 1st marks my three-year anniversary at boston college. i\u2019m not so na\u00efve as to think it\u2019s been all roses, although through the combined efforts of our staff, the support from the university administration and a collaborative and entrepreneurial approach it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ve accomplished a lot in a relatively short period. i\u2019d like to highlight a few items, and then provide a glimpse going forward. when i arrived many folks were expecting immediate changes to our operations. instead, we took a more strategic view, and i asked our staff to help establish a culture that valued collaboration and innovation, had a reasonable tolerance for risk and focused on our library users. i did not want people to think i had all the answers or that all the fine work before i entered the picture was devalued. so we adopted the \u201cgood to great\u201d mantra and began to work in a learning environment that was both vertically and horizontally integrated, as well as reaching out to faculty and students with open interest and with the knowledge that we do indeed value and respond to their input. during my first summer, based on faculty input we allocated 150k of funds to address holes in the monographs collections. virtually every faculty request was met. in subsequent years we have purchased many digital journal back files and other one-time cost databases. our collections budget has grown significantly, and we strive to meet all faculty requests. though maintaining a robust collections budget that mirrors journal inflation continues to be a challenge, we are working closely with the provost to ensure that we maintain access to all materials needed by everyone in our community. our physical spaces have been in need of refurbishment for a long time. to that end we have taken a measured longer-term view of space utilization. we began with a renovated educational resource center in 2009. around the same time the group study rooms on o\u2019neill level five were equipped with new furniture and technology conducive for project-based collaborative learning. we also opened up the o\u2019neill library level one entrance by the maloney building and installed printing, look-up technology, new seating, a popular reading collection, a student art gallery and a few vending machines for student convenience, as well as a service point. moreover, we have updated our microfilm area and are currently exploring the latest technologies to make use of microforms easier and more efficient. we are currently planning a summer project that will further transform the level one spaces by adding more user seating, maximizing natural light and creating collaborative opportunities for our students. o\u2019neill level three, the main floor, has also undergone a transformation. the former reserves room has been expanded and made into a reading area with a mixed landscape of furniture. the o\u2019neill reading room has become an important destination for students for quiet study as well as small group meetings. a new business service center concept was introduced this past fall on level three in what was formerly known as the current periodicals area. this space had been occupied with unbound periodicals and a few printers. however, we realized that not only was the area not particularly inviting, we were missing opportunities to provide enhanced business-like services to users. renovated with a service desk and equipment the new business center provides assistance for printing, basic technology, copying, scanning and reformatting materials. to get the additional space, we removed print journals that were available in digital format. the result was the addition of about 50 new student seats and a sustainable business center that is very effective at serving user needs. we have also installed some new monitors in the lobby and created a more user-friendly new books area. the monitor as you enter the o\u2019neill library conveys library information. the vertical monitor in the lobby focuses on community information, such as bc-sanctioned events and student interest materials. the monitor near the new book shelves highlights our digital collections, both in burns and bc\u2019s other libraries. because an important part of our overall plan calls for greater appreciation and use of our world-class special collections, we have recently installed two elegant display cases in the o\u2019neill reading room that highlight our burns materials and collections. three new display cases are being installed in the o\u2019neill lobby later this spring that will emphasize our vast collections and resources and serve as opportunities for commemorating boston college\u2019s sesquicentennial. the library will be a key contributor to this yearlong celebration by, among other programs, highlighting our many treasures in the burns library through a robust digitalization program as well as this new and expanded approach to exhibits. we are in the process of reviewing our overall service program. we are going to put resources into enhancing the first year experience. we will also integrate all collection and public services librarians into our instruction program across departments and schools. moreover, we have been using technology to reach out to library users with mobile apps for smart phones, text messaging, e-mail and facebook. we are also implementing e-book services that can be used with most devices (kindle, nook, ipad, etc.) in addition, we will be examining the changing purpose of the traditional reference desk and exploring scenarios that better enhance the user experience for our services, collections and spaces. we will continue to look into what \u201copen access\u201d means for boston college and further develop our institutional repository. finally, e-science initiatives are being explored and again, we will be seeing what works best for boston college. future projects and directions will continue with the \u201cgood to great\u201d theme, but with an emphasis on resource allocation and content integration. ultimately this process will guide us in making choices that: 1) determine where we will commit to distinction; 2) identify areas for growth, opportunity and innovation, with calculated risk; and 3) ensure we completely support all those operations without which the former two areas cannot be sustained. in closing i want to extend heartfelt appreciation to all of you that have made these past three years productive and gratifying. i am proud to be part of a great university. input from thoughtful faculty and students have been drivers in most of the above initiatives, and the staff in the libraries has shown great resolve in making these things not only possible, but also real. finally, special thanks to the senior administration of boston college for their ongoing support. as always, feel free to contact me with concerns, suggestions and ideas. tom wall university librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston college libraries",

(\"the cost of an g\u00fam,\" irish independent, 24 january 1966. translation of \"costas an gh\u00faim\" which appeared in comhar, november, 1965.) the 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of independent publishing houses which focused on creative writing in irish. in response an g\u00fam began to focus increasingly on fiction for children and young adults, most notably thrillers, detective fiction and educational texts. foremost among the fiction for young adults were the novels of cathal \u00f3 sandair and miche\u00e1l d'and\u00fan. cathal \u00f3 s\u00e1ndair, one of the most prolific irish language authors, produced over one hundred novels, many of them westerns featuring cowboys and gun fights. born in weston super mare, england to an english father and irish mother, his family moved to ireland when he was a child. while still a school boy \u00f3 sandair published a story in the first issue of the magazine gael \u00f3g in 1938. his first novel appeared in 1943 and featured r\u00e9ics carl\u00f3, the most famous irish language detective. in addition to the many adventures of r\u00e9ics carl\u00f3, \u00f3 s\u00e1ndair wrote a series of novels featuring the character r\u00e9amonn \u00f3g. the third strand of his fiction centered on school adventures where boys and girls inevitably save the day. \u00f3 s\u00e1ndair is reputed to have published 160 books and sold more than 500,000 copies. title: r\u00e9amonn \u00f3g agus marcaigh na ho\u00edche (r\u00e9amonn \u00f3g and the night riders) published: 1957 author: cathal \u00f3 sandair (1922-1996) artwork: l.m.s. source: private collection title: tr\u00ed d\u00fanmharfa go leith (three and a half murders) published: 1956 author: m\u00edche\u00e1l d'and\u00fan artwork: unsigned source: private collection title: thiar i ngleann ceo (beyond in misty valley) published: 1953 author: tadhg \u00f3 rabhartaigh (1909-1982) artwork: unsigned source: private collection comment: \u00f3 rabhartaigh translated annie m.p. smithson's novel her irish heritage for an g\u00fam .", "hrefTitle": "Conclusion", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual/bkcovers.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Francis W.

burns library introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion more than a mascot: a symbol for the university in october 1954 boston college received the statue of an eagle that had been in a japanese garden on the estate of larz anderson in brookline, massachusetts. the garden was designed and planted in 1907, and a photograph in 1909 clearly shows the eagle. this happened before anderson\u2019s appointment as ambassador to japan (1912-1913). after the deaths of larz anderson and his wife isabel, many possessions of the estate were distributed to people who had worked for the andersons. they included augustus (gus) m. anderson (no relation), who had been born on the estate and had worked as a private secretary for isabel anderson for over 40 years. \u201cgus\u201d wanted to find a good place for the statue. he had displayed it outside his house but was worried about damage from hurricanes and other storms. he was a fan of boston college and knew that its mascot was the eagle. working with thomas m. herlihy, sj, pastor of st. ignatius parish, gus anderson donated the statue to the college. we are grateful to augustus anderson\u2019s daughter, betty anderson riley, and her cousin, gerry hayes, for providing much of this information. the photograph was taken by isabel anderson and published in house and garden magazine and published in 1909. mrs. riley told us about an earlier connection between isabel anderson and boston college: mrs. anderson wrote a play, \u201cdick whittington,\u201d which bc students performed enthusiastically in the 1930\u2019s. in 1957, boston college received the column and base of the admiral george dewey memorial from the city of boston. the memorial had stood in front of south station in dewey square and was taken down to make way for the central artery project. the column was placed in front of gasson hall, at the end of linden lane, and the eagle sculpture was mounted on the top. the prominent placement of the statue was clear evidence of the eagle's importance to the identity of the university. the base of the dewey memorial is crafted out of pink granite and is located in the center of the quad that is formed by lyons, gasson, devlin and fulton halls. it consists of the sculpted prows of four ships each traveling in one of four different directions. as if made deliberately for boston college, a carved eagle is on the edge of each ship's prow. a student is pictured here sitting on the base. a photograph of the eagle on the 30 foot-tall, marble pillar at the end of linden lane. in 1993, the original bronze sculpture was replaced with an exact replica. due to the harsh new england winters, the original had begun to crack and could not withstand the natural elements for much longer. the work was done by skylight studios (woburn, massachusetts), a firm that has handled restoration projects for the museum of fine arts. the firm first made cosmetic repairs to the original, then created a mold and finally cast a replica. this photograph shows tom cipolla cleaning the sculpture as he created a mold of it. like the original, the identical replica stands four feet high and has a six-foot wing span. photograph by gary gilbert, office of marketing communications today the eagle sculpture in front of gasson hall is one of the most photographed locations on boston college's campus. it has become almost a rite of passage for proud parents to take photographs of newly admitted students or graduating seniors in front of the statue, with gasson hall in the background. photograph courtesy of office of marketing communications, boston college introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion \u00ab back : next \u00bb", "hrefTitle": "Symbol", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual/eagle.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "Boston College Eagle -

burns library introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion mascot: live, stuffed and costumed in the fall of 1923, boston college was presented with a gift of a live eagle (it was actually a hawk). surviving a horrible storm, the exhausted bird landed on a fishing schooner fifty miles out from the coast of chatham, massachusetts. the ship, itself, had barely survived the storm. the bird became entangled in the ship's rigging and was rescued by the crew. having read of the school's recent adoption of the eagle as a mascot, they presented the bird as a gift to boston college. with a diet of buffalo meat and the tender care of father daniel lynch, sj, the bird soon regained its strength. alas, less than two weeks after arriving at the heights, the bird flew away on sunday morning prior to the game with marquette university. bc lost the game by one point. football captain charles darling is pictured with the \"eagle.\" in the spring of 1924, a bald eagle was captured on a new mexico ranch and sent to boston college by rev. john a. risacher, s.j. (a former teacher at boston college high school). this event received national attention as the bird was captured by a cowboy employed on the ranch of senator albert b. fall. the eagle was never officially named but became known to the students as \"herpy.\" a junior, in jest, had pointed out the relationship between a \"bald\" head and a certain remedy for hair loss known as \"herpicide.\" unfortunately, herpy was rather unhappy with his new home and tried to bite through his cage, resulting in an injured beak and other ailments. the eagle was sent to angell memorial hospital and upon his release given to the franklin park zoo. a snapshot of rev. john a. risacher, s.j. is reproduced here. with the loss of herpy, father risacher gave boston college a stuffed and mounted golden eagle that had an eight-foot-long wingspan. the stuffed bird served as the official boston college eagle from 1923 through 1961. it is pictured with john culhane, charles darling, joseph kozlowski and edward harrison (left to right) in a keystone view company of new york image. in the spring of 1961, three students (john d. provasoli, robert hart and james mclaughlin), unhappy with bc's stuffed mascot, launched \"project mascot,\" an effort to secure a live golden eagle. boston college met the governmental requirements, inoculations, and necessary housing required to keep a live eagle. the university was assisted by walter stone, superintendent of the franklin park zoo. the zoo, in fact, housed and cared for the bird. margo is pictured here. in september 1961, the eagle was named \"margo\" after a student-run name-the-eagle contest. the name was formed by combining the first letters of the boston college colors, maroon and gold. margo was brought to every home game for five seasons and to selected away games. unfortunately, in august 1966, margo was struck by aviary virus and died in the franklin park zoo. a photograph of margo with a student handler is reproduced here. stricter regulations against capturing endangered species and a greater sensitivity about a captured animal's welfare prevented boston college from again using a live mascot. instead, boston college employed a costumed human mascot. the costumed mascot acted less as a symbol and more like a supplementary cheerleader. here one of the earliest costumed mascots is pictured. the twenty-first century has brought boston college two costumed mascots named \"baldwin\" and \"baldwin jr.\" baldwin is six and a half feet tall with many bird-like features, including wings with well designed feathers. \"baldwin, jr.\" is a nine and a half foot tall mascot with inflatable features. here baldwin encourages the fans at alumni stadium. photograph courtesy media relations department, athletic

eagle virtual exhibit summer 2005 - burns library introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion adoption of the eagle as the university mascot prior to 1920, boston college lacked a mascot. in the spring of 1920, the boston college track team won the eastern intercollegiate competitions. charlie donelan of the boston traveler illustrated the mascot-less collegiate team as a stray cat lapping up the opposition. this did not sit very well with one loyal alumnus who voiced his displeasure to the heights editorial staff. identified at the time only as \"the old man,\" the alum suggested that the lack of a school mascot led to the insulting cartoon. in his letter published in the may 14, 1920 issue, he suggested to the current student body, \"why not select - the eagle, symbolic of majesty, power, and freedom. its natural habitat is the high places. surely, the heights is made to order for such a suggestion.\" the old man was later identified as rev. edward j. mclaughlin (ex-1914). this is a portrait of mclaughlin circa 1954. in response to the old man's letter, the editor of the heights , reminded his fellow students that the cause of the insulting cartoon was not the fault of the sports cartoonist, as the student body (past and present) had never come up with a mascot. he wrote: \"the fault is ours entirely. it is important that we adopt a mascot to preside at our pow-wows and triumphant fetes.\" he urged students to write to the heights to voice their opinion of the eagle or voice an alternative for the school mascot. in the june 17th issue, the first published drawing of an eagle appeared in a corner of the special pictorial edition. the artwork was not credited but was probably the work of either robert p. walsh (1922) or j. robert brawley (1920), both members of the newspaper's art department. known as the \"college cartoonist,\" j. robert brawley (1920) claimed to have drawn the first sketch of the eagle. mclaughlin's letter was brought to the attention of the student athletic association moderated by rev. richard a. o'brien, s.j. in 1944, brawley recalled \"i was sold on the eagle idea of father mclaughlin...i went to work into that night...i grabbed a big sheet of drawing board, some water colors and went to work...when i got done, i had so much paint on it, the board must have weighed five pounds...the supplies really caught it that night. i brought the sketch into the school the next morning to father o'brien and he put it on the bulletin board with the notation that it was the proposed new mascot. it was a sketch of an eagle bearing in its talons a bc banner and soaring over a bulldog crouched in the shadow of the football. that's all i did...the eagle won. father mclaughlin [had] the idea, he presented it and it was chosen. i am grateful for the credit i have received but father mclaughlin was the creator of the eagle.\" brawley's yearbook photograph is reproduced here. there was much excitement when boston college defeated the heavily favored yale university football team in games played in 1919 and 1920. in the october 15, 1920 issue of the heights , bc athlete luke urban was pictured in a cartoon drawn by john t. sullivan. he was shown with a bald eagle perched on his shoulder, taming the yale bulldog. in the same issue, the editor noted his disappointment that the local newspaper cartoonists still represented boston college as \"a sort of flat impersonal picture of a foot-ball player bearing a neat and inoffensive tag.\" he went on that the \"university heights has the altitude, the rocks, the trees, and the general wild and free aspect which go to make up the popular conception of what an eagle's surroundings should be...we want the eagle for the boston college mascot.\" a month later, in the november 12 issue, an editorial entitled \"about that bird\" was published. the editorial goaded the college's cartoonists to feature the eagle in their efforts, as \"the work of getting the idea accepted lies almost entirely with them.\" they encouraged their readers to continue to voice their opinions. a month later, the heights art department staff member john t. sullivan (1924) drew the boldest cartoon depiction of the heights to date, showing an eagle knocking a holy cross football player from the top of gasson tower. the cartoon celebrates bc's 14-0 victory over their bitter rival and, more important, clearly depicts the eagle as the symbol of boston college. the university quickly adopted the eagle more formally into campus life. a column dedicated to sports entitled \"through the eagle's eye\" appeared for the first time in the january 20, 1921 issue of the heights. the relay team was pictured in the february 2 issue with an eagle emblem incorporated into their athletic-wear. alumnus j. robert brawley, perhaps answering the call of current students for cartoons representing the eagle, contributed two significant pieces to the 1921 sub turri yearbook. this piece celebrated that season's undefeated football team earning the eastern championship. obviously, this depiction was more fitting than the cartoon that depicted bc as a stray cat in the previous year. father mclaughlin must have been a happy man. introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion \u00ab back : next \u00bb", "hrefTitle": "Adoption", "refURL":

2001 - burns library introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940 the 1940 team is perhaps the greatest football team in the history of boston college. expectations ran high in 1940, after the previous year's team earned the school's first appearance in a bowl game (boston college lost to clemson in the cotton bowl). the 1940 team became known as the \"team of destiny.\" in his second year at boston college, coach frank leahy had a team of great talent. charlie o'rourke was the quarterback and his backs included veterans frank maznicki, lou montgomery (boston college's first african-american football player), and captain henry toczylowski. they were joined by a talented newcomer named mike holovak. the team also had wonderful receivers including henry woronicz, gene goodreault, ed zabilski and don currivan. the team was undefeated outscoring its opponents 320 to 52 and held six teams scoreless. boston college impressed the sports community by defeating tulane university (considered the second best team in the nation) 27 to 7 in the second week of the season and defeating georgetown 19 to 18 (snapping georgetown's streak of twenty-two consecutive wins). on january 1, 1941, boston college defeated tennessee in the sugar bowl 19 to 13. the eagles earned a number five ranking in the 1940 ap national poll and laid claim to the national championship. the sugar bowl

professional football with the chicago bears, baltimore colts and the los angles dons between 1942 and 1950. mike holovak played professional football for both the los angeles rams and the chicago bears between 1946 and 1948. he later coached the boston college football team from 1951 to 1959 and the boston patriots from 1961 to 1968. all three men have been inducted into the boston college hall of fame. holovak and o'rourke were also inducted into the national football foundation & college hall of fame. pictured here is a cover of a souvenir program from the seventh annual sugar bowl game. the eagles were underdogs in the match with the tennessee volunteers. before a crowd of 73,000, boston college staged an upset victory. the teams were tied 13 to 13 with only three minutes left to play. charlie o'rourke rallied the team down the field and ran twenty-four yards for the game winning touchdown. the final score was 19 to 13. here charles darling (right) is handing players henry woronicz (left) and theodore williams (center) a bowl of sugar at south station as the eagles board their new orleans-bound train. darling (class of 1925) was a legendary player from the early twenties. the image illustrates the loyalty and support that past boston college players and alumni give to current athletics. 75,000 to 100,000 enthusiastic fans greeted the victorious eagles upon their return to boston. later, 1700 people attended a victory banquet held at the ballroom of the hotel statler. the great team of 1920 sat together as a unit and toasted the newest team of destiny. eagles past and present were united by a love of sport and a love of boston college. a tradition that continues to this day. introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940", "hrefTitle": "1940", "refURL":

research evaluate sources evaluating your resources is an important step of research. the following categories will assist in determining whether or not the material you found is appropriate for what you need. when evaluating the information sources you have found it is a good idea to evaluate the credibility and perspective of the author. this excercise is an example of some approaches you might take. exercise: evaluate the following citation asking yourself these questions. montessori, maria. childhood education. chicago: regenery, 1974. contents author what are the credentials of the author? what is her educational background? has she written a book in this area? do an author search in holmes to find another book by the author, or use online databases specializing in identifying biographical information. also, you may use general or subject-specific databases to see if the author has written any articles. has your instructor or professor mentioned this author? have other types of publications made references to this author? other scholars often cite good authors. does the author have an association with an institution or an organization? what are the fundamental values or goals of the institution or organization, and how might those values and goals affect the credibility of your paper? content analysis \u00ab prev next \u00bb you should now examine the source in your hand. if you are considering a book as a source, go through the preface to determine what the author proposes to do in the book. look through the table of contents and index to see what is covered in the book. if bibliographies are included, you may use the sources to locate further information. if you are considering an article as a source, read the first few paragraphs and the last few paragraphs of the article carefully. also, page through the article to look for labeled section headings. read the first and last paragraph of any large labeled sections. this selective reading of an article will help you determine whether it will be useful to your research before you invest several hours reading the entire article. audience what is the audience the author is addressing? general? specialized? does the information appear to be too elementary or too technical? objectivity and reliability is the information in the source fact or opinion? is the information well researched and based on reasonable evidence? does the author attempt to be impartial? is the author's choice of words fair and serious or unprofessional and biased? coverage does the particular source update some of the other information you have on the topic? does it provide an in-depth or shallow analysis of your topic? is the source primary or secondary? a primary source suggests original creation or first-hand experience (for example, an eyewitness account of history, an autobiography, or a novel, poem, or play). a secondary source suggests a commentary on a primary source (for example, a biography, a history, or a critical reading of a novel, play, or poem). evaluative reviews if you would like to check reviews of a book you are considering as a source, consult such resources as book review index (o'neill library index range 1) or book review digest plus (online). for more information on how to find book reviews see the research guide \" finding book reviews \". is the review positive? is the book under review considered a valuable contribution to the field? does the reviewer mention other books that might be better? if so, locate these sources for more information on your topic. for web sites, consult the following internet resource: evaluation of information sources date, edition, & publisher date of publication when was the source published? is the information now out of date? for many topics, older information is still very valuable, but in some cases (for example, aids research) people often want material as up-to-date as possible. if you are using a web document, you can see the date of the last revision at the bottom of the page. consider the nature of your topic. is the information in your hand up-to-date? many topics in the sciences require current and up-to-date information. often in the humanities, both old and up-to-date information may be useful. edition or revision what edition are you looking at? books that have other editions indicate that the information has been frequently updated. depending on your research topic, determine the currency of your information needs. publisher university press books are likely to be scholarly. a publisher's reputation may not always guarantee an excellent publication, but prestigious publishers are more likely to pay attention to quality. internet resources evaluating the information that you have found is an important step in the research process. since anyone can publish on the internet, you want to be sure that the information you are getting is accurate and reliable. it is necessary to know who authored the site, credibility and perspective of the author, the intended audience, the scope of the information covered, and how recently the site was updated. evaluating information from the internet is a guide created specifically to address the issues involved in utilizing internet resources. exercise: use the guide evaluating information from the internet to evaluate the perseus project website. type of journal, magazine, newspaper scholarly/substantial these can be subdivided into the following categories: scholarly journals, substantive news or general interest, popular periodicals, and tabloids. check out the university of arizona tutorial to test your knowledge of the differences. scholarly journals: scholarly journals contain reviews and articles written by experts in the field. scholarly journals always cite their sources in the form of footnotes or bibliographies. they are generally published four or six times a year. examples of scholarly journals: journal of geology jen: journal of emergency nursing counseling psychologist new england journal of medicine substantive news or general interest: substantive news or general interest sources are usually attractive in appearance, and may include photographs. some, though not very many, may cite sources. authors of articles appearing in this type of publication include editorial staff, scholars, and freelance writers. they are generally published far more frequently than scholarly journals. examples of substantive news or general interest periodicals: the boston globe national geographic scientific american the wall street journal popular periodicals popular periodicals: popular periodicals come in many formats and are most often colorful in appearance, with lots of photographs and/or graphics. the most reliable kind of popular periodical often cites sources (though perhaps not in standard bibliographical format), but the less reliable kind will seldom cite sources. use your own judgment to determine reliability of a popular periodical, or ask a reference librarian. the purpose of many popular periodicals is to provide news coverage or financial information; the purpose of others is to entertain or promote particular viewpoints. again, use your own judgment to measure reliability or ask a reference librarian. examples of popular periodicals: business week ebony readers digest sports illustrated examples of tabloids: national examiner star sun weekly world news reference sources for more information on individual periodical titles: there are reference books which describe and evaluate periodicals. for evaluations of specific periodicals use: magazines for libraries (o'neill library reference desk: pn 4832 m323x) standard periodical directory (o'neill library reference desk: z6951.s78) ulrich's international periodicals directory (online), or ulrich's international periodicals directory -- print

frank cavanaugh, including quarterback al weston, half-back patrick creedon, all-american end charlie murphy and captain warren mcguirk. memorable games included a 6 to 0 upset over navy, a 60 to 6

coach mckenney (class of 1927), as a student, was the eagle's 1926 team captain and a co-all-eastern quarterback. in 1928, at the age of twenty-three, he became boston college's coach. during his seven years, his teams had a combined record of 44 wins 17 loss and 4 ties. mckenney later served as an official for both college football and national football league games. he also presided over a hastily organized fundraising campaign for a new boston college stadium in 1957 and this remains one of his most important contributions to boston college. he was named to the boston college hall of fame in 1970, the professional football hall of fame in 1983, and the national football foundation & college hall of fame in 1988. he died in 1995. this is a photograph of captain warren mcguirk (class of 1929). one of his greatest sports moments came in the 1927 game against holy cross when he recovered the ball after a blocked punt and ran in the game-winning touchdown. mcguirk would later be the university of massachusetts' dean of the school of physical education and director of athletics for over three decades. he was inducted into the boston college hall of fame in 1970. pictured here is quarterback al weston (class of 1929). weston was considered one of the greatest running quarterbacks of his day. he was also captain of the baseball team and the first baseman. one of weston's greatest football moments came in 1928 when ran in the game winning touchdown, and the game's only points, in the 6 to 0 upset over navy. he was the team's scoring leader in the 1926, 1927 and 1928 seasons. weston would later play professional baseball with the boston braves. he was inducted into the boston college hall of fame in 1970. shown here is the cover of the 1928 boston college - holy cross game program. boston college won this game 19 to 0 and cleared the last hurdle for the eastern championship. the annual game between boston college and holy cross was a historic rivalry between the two premier catholic colleges of new england. the feelings aroused by the annual match were somewhat akin to today's boston college - notre dame rivalry. the teams first played each other in 1896 and the games continued until 1986 when holy cross ended the series. boston college's record against holy cross is 48 wins, 31 losses and 3 ties. this is the cover of the dinner program held in celebration of boston college's second eastern championship. the banquet was held on january 8, 1929 at the elk's hotel. boston college had reason to take pride in the achievement's of joseph mckenney's team. the school's football program was achieving national recognition as one of strongest in new england. in the decade to come, as sports historian jack falla suggests, the next logical step would have been more intersectional matches and possible appearances in college bowl games. alas, the financial difficulties suffered at boston college during the great depression put these aspirations on hold for a decade. introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940", "hrefTitle": "1928", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/burnsvirtual/teams.html"},

herbert treat. this is a photograph-postcard of alumni field in the early 1920s. after the move to chestnut hill, games were originally played on a municipally owned field next to the chestnut hill reservoir. funded primarily with alumni contributions, alumni field was dedicated on october 20, 1915 and was used for football, baseball and track. it had a limited seating capacity of only 5000. to accommodate larger crowds, football games were also played in local stadiums such as fenway park and braves field. pictured here is coach frank w. cavanaugh who coached at boston college from 1919 to 1926. from 1911 to 1916, he had successfully coached dartmouth college and then served in the united states army during world war i. cavanaugh was severely injured by shrapnel and earned the nickname of the \"iron major.\" sports historian jack falla characterized his boston college teams as being \"aggressive-some said intimidating-and exceptionally well conditioned.\" his teams at boston college had a combined record of 48-14-5. cavanaugh left boston college to coach at fordham university. his teams at fordham also had a reputation for strong defense and the front line became known as the \"seven blocks of granite.\" he died just prior to the start of the 1938 season. in 1943, he was made the subject of a hollywood movie, starring pat o'brien, called \"the iron major.\" cavanaugh was inducted into the national football foundation & college hall of fame in 1954 and into the boston college hall of fame in 1970. jimmy \"fitzy\" fitzpatrick (class of 1921) was a speedy half-back with multiple talents. he could pass left or right-handed, had a career punting average of sixty-five yards and possessed a long-range for his drop kick field goals. fitzpatrick was elected team captain in 1919, but when invited to be captain again in 1920 he modestly refused, allowing his friend luke urban to be unanimously chosen. his football career came to an end after his shoulder was broken in the november 1920 game against georgetown. he was the team's scoring leader in the 1916, 1917, and 1919 seasons. in 1921, cavanaugh praised him as \"the greatest athlete boston college has ever had...i doubt that any has ever done more for his college in athletics than fitzy has done for boston college.\" fitzpatrick was inducted into boston college's hall of fame in 1970. boston college proved itself to be a team of national distinction by deafeating the heavily favored squads from yale university in both 1919 and 1920. in 1919, boston college won by a score of 5 to 3. jimmy fitzpatrick's greatest moment came in the 1919 game against yale when he drop-kicked a game winning forty-seven yard field goal with only two minutes left to play. for years to come, alumni referred to this play as \"the kick.\" in 1920, they won 21 to 13. this cartoon appeared on the front cover of the october 13, 1920 issue of the heights (boston college's student newspaper). the image shows luke urban training the yale bulldog. this is the cover of a development brochure produced for the 1921 boston college building campaign. the 1920 eastern champions are figured prominently in the brochure indicating the growing importance of athletics for the university's external visibility and fundraising efforts. the eagle was adopted as the college mascot in early 1920 and quickly became a prominent symbol of boston college. the 1920 team had the proud distinction to be the first team officially called the \"eagles.\" introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940", "hrefTitle": "1920",

was located in boston's south end, on james street, next to the immaculate conception church. the faculty residence is the building in the foreground. though the administration sanctioned intercollegiate football in 1893, boston college lacked a true athletic field and games had to be played outside college grounds. team practices were held on a small field near the college on st. james street. students also had use of the college's indoor gymnasium, pictured here, with a running track and modest equipment this is a detail from the team photograph showing captain charles kiley. kiley played the left-end position and 1899 was his third year on the team. at the end of the 1898 season, he had been elected team captain for the 1899 season. the coverage of this event in the stylus noted that kiley was \"popular with the players\" and had \"many qualities which go to make a strong leader.\" not much is known about kiley other than that he lived on tyler street in boston and was enrolled in the \"special class in collegiate english\" from the 1897/1898 through the 1900/1901 academic years. james joseph kenney was the team's center and this photograph of him illustrates the equipment used by football players of the era. his only pieces of protective equipment were his heavily padded pants, a leather nose-guard and a thick turtleneck sweater. kenney would later be the captain of the 1901 team. shown here is the cover of a program from alumni-sponsored dinner honoring the success of the 1899 team. the dinner was held at the elegant parker house on january 9, 1900. the team was greeted and praised by sixty-five invited diners (mostly boston college alumni, faculty and staff). boston college had much to be proud of as the team received prominent coverage in many local newspapers. the editor of boston college's stylus noted that \"the team and its management deserve the highest credit for bringing the institution they represented so prominently into more wide spread notice...since athletics have come to signify so much in the modern college life, such publicity is both welcome and desirable.\" even at this early date, athletics

(however, lawsuits are brewing by certain publishers and authors who contend that the project will adversely affect their interests). some may find google book search useful for locating cited references. method of searching: click on the advanced search link. type (for example) john l mahoney in the exact phrase box. the phrase john l mahoney was found on over 900 pages in over 40 books. a brief perusal seemed to show that most of these referred to the english dept.\u2019s prof. mahoney. you may see the dust jacket or book cover of the retrieved books on the left of the entry. and one may click on the link(s) to see the actual pages where the phrase john l. mahoney was found. in some cases access is restricted. this may be because a publisher placed some sort of embargo on google displaying the full-text of even a small number of pages. of course, the results of this search only indicate the occurrence of \u201cjohn l mahoney\u201d in books already digitized and made available by google \u2013 presumably still a relatively small number. and it is most probable that \u201cjohn l mahoney\u201d is mentioned on more than 900+ pages of the world\u2019s books. moreover, prof. mahoney will be mentioned other than as john l mahoney , e.g. mahoney , john mahoney , j. l. mahoney , dr. mahoney etc. but doing a search for just mahoney amazon.com amazon.com has a search inside!\u2122 feature whereby one can search millions of pages to find occurrences of a word or phrase \u2013 or indeed a cited reference. search inside! results are displayed interspersed with the standard results. it is important to remember, however, that only a small proportion of the books in amazon\u2019s database participate in this feature. method of searching: let's say that you're interested in finding books that have the phrase \"michael j himes\". just like any other search, simply type \"michael j himes\" in the search box and click go! you'll get a list of the books that contain that term in the author's name, the book's title, or in the book's text. books participating in amazon\u2019s search inside! program (again, only a small proportion) with \"michael j himes\" in their text will show an excerpt with the search term highlighted. to see all references to \"michael j himes.\" within a participating book, click the \"see more references to michael j himes in this book\" link. to see the page containing the excerpt, simply click the page number. psycinfo, sociological abstracts, worldwide political science abstracts psychinfo provides abstracts and citations to the scholarly literature in the behavioral sciences and mental health. includes material of relevance to psychologists and professionals in related fields such as psychiatry, management, business, education, social science, neuroscience, law, medicine, and social work. sociological abstracts contains abstracts and indexes of the international literature in sociology and related disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences. the database provides abstracts of journal articles and citations to book reviews drawn from over 1,800+ serials publications, and also provides abstracts of books, book chapters, dissertations, and conference papers. worldwide political science abstracts includes citations and abstracts of the international serials literature in political science and its complementary fields, including international relations, law, and public administration and public policy. over 1400 titles are monitored for coverage. the methods of searching for cited references are the same for all three databases. let's search, for example, the psycinfo database. method of searching: on the advanced search screen one may combine search term(s) with references, re= in the pull-down menu. for example, search for an author or authors, e.g.: re=(kanwisher) search for a publication year, e.g.: re=(2000) search for a specific publication, e.g.: re=(journal of neuroscience) search for a publisher, e.g.: re=(cambridge university press) one may combine the above searches in the one search. when constructing your search strategy, please keep in mind the large size of the references field and the numerous citations that one references field could possibly contain. a search for a specific author and publication year in the references field could easily retrieve false hits. for example, a search for re=(costa and 1985) could retrieve the name costa from citation number two and the 1985 publication date from citation number twelve. the use of proximity operators in your search strategy can help to eliminate false hits. incorporate proximity operators into your search strategy to ensure that a search containing two or more separate data elements only retrieves relevant citations, e.g.: re=(costa) within 12 (1985) . still, caution is advised.

jesuit cultural learnings\". de christiana expeditione apud sinas , 1615. the full title of this book, translated into english, reads \"the christian expedition among the chinese undertaken by the society of jesus from the commentaries of fr. matteo ricci of the same society... in which the customs, laws, and principles of the chinese kingdom and the most difficult first beginnings of the new church there are accurately and with great fidelity described / authored by fr. nicolas trigault, flemish, of the same society.\" the highly accomplished flemish jesuit trigault arrived as a missionary in china in 1610 and died there in 1618; the text featured to the left is his latin translation of matteo ricci's unpublished diary text. one of the earliest and most competent accounts of chinese history and civilization by a european, it introduces the reader to european experiences in china dating back to the tang dynasty (618-907) while offering a comprehensive look at chinese culture and society. ricci is perhaps the most famous of all jesuit missionaries in china, noted for his mastery of its language and manners, and his effective, culturally sensitive approach to evangelizing that proud, ancient civilization. frontispiece map detail from de christiana expeditione apud sinas, 1615. updated: april 5, 2011 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback |

nursing history, including original letters by florence nightingale, a 19th century pharmaceutical cabinet and a first edition (1859) of florence nightingale\u2019s notes on nursing: what it is, and what it is not . one of the items featured in this exhibit is a letter written by florence nightingale, dated april 1, 1855, from the barracks hospital in scutari, turkey. this letter is part of the josephine a. dolan collection of nursing history. in this letter, nightingale writes to an acquaintance, a mrs. lewis. nightingale laments the toll that dysentery has taken on some people of their mutual acquaintance. in february 1855, the death rate at the barracks hospital in scutari where nightingale was posted, was 42%. a few months later, the death rate had decreased to 2%. prior to nightingale\u2019s arrival, sanitary conditions at this hospital were so deplorable that a royal inquiry was put in place to investigate the horrible illnesses and sufferings of soldiers at the barracks hospital in scutari. nightingale wrote to britain\u2019s secretary of war sidney herbert to offer her services. nightingale arrived in scutari on november 4th, 1854 and she spent many hours in the wards, patrolling with a lamp to give personal care to the wounded. thus she became known as the \u201clady with the lamp\u201d. nursing professor and historian josephine a. dolan (1913 \u2013 2004) became the first instructor in the school of nursing at the university of connecticut in 1944. at the university of connecticut, dolan taught a course on the history of nursing, often using primary sources to illustrate this subject to her students. she pursued nursing history for the remainder of her lengthy career, including her work with the committee on historic source materials in nursing. dolan received many honors, including the first national league for nursing distinguished service award (1972), an honorary degree from boston college (1987), and the massachusetts nurses association\u2019s lucy lincoln drown nursing history society\u2019s award (1992). the burns library would also like to thank professor stacey barone and her \u201cintroduction to professional nursing\u201d class for providing the inspiration for this exhibition, which brings together the past, present and future of nursing. for more information, see the josephine a. dolan collection of

area in khartoum, sudan which occurred earlier this year in april. sudanese/amercian artist khalid kodi, adjunct professor of the fine arts department at boston college, initiated the project with the help of a multi-religious and multi-ethnic team of artists who are students at boston college. the team spent summer 2012 working on a series of large-scale, high-quality biblical paintings as part of a greater effort to rebuild the church in khartoum. the project is firmly rooted in universal principles of and commitment to peaceful co-existence and social justice. in addition to painting, the amen project conducted interviews with leaders in the fields of education and religion; dr. abdel-rahman ibrahim mohamed, father david hollenbach, s.j, professor catherine cornille, professor john michalczyk, professor crystal tiala, and father raymond helmick, s.j. who commented on the meanings of the church burning incident, and on the response professor kodi and his students initiated. these

from the entire bc student body. the works emphasize the formal elements of portrait-making as well as the underlying theoretical concepts. in some cases portraits can be considered as \u201clikenesses\u201d that have been constructed in such a way as to convey a certain feeling or sensation via their formal elements. in other cases, portraits rely more on the psychological effect of the subject and less on the creation of a believable \u201clikeness.\u201d this exhibition displays the breadth which the field of portraiture has to offer through the hands of bc artists. about

breaking a larger assignment into smaller manageable steps is helpful to students. take time to discuss a focus on the research question, reframing a research question, time management and effective information seeking strategies. if time allows, spend time discussing the importance of evaluating sources. discuss plagiarism- discuss academic integrity and the importance of doing honest academic research and writing. define for students how to attribute sources through proper citation. the library offers citation sessions each semester that are open to all students. see the calendar for upcoming workshops. collaborate with instructional librarians - each subject area at boston college is assigned a subject liaison librarian . the librarians are subject specialists and can assist you in designing effective research assignments that will help students develop the skills necessary to locate and evaluate information as well as introduce the students to relevant subject specific resources. test your assignment- try out your assignment yourself to make sure that your students will understand how to find the necessary resources and to verify that the sources in question are readily available. librarians can assist you in locating additional resources if necessary. schedule a library class session - librarians are available to come to your class or book a class in a library classroom to go over subject specific resources, information seeking tips and strategies, how to cite, and many other related topics. it may also be helpful to alert your subject liaison to student assignments so that your subject liaison can assist students individually if needed. communicate feedback - instructional librarians are interested in hearing from you about what worked and what did not. where would you like more focus in the future? what was your assessment of the overall experience students had completing the paper or assignment? your feedback helps strengthen the library instructional program. updated: january 25, 2013 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Examples/Tips Foreffective Instructionsessions", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/help/LibraryInstructionalSupport.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "University Libraries -

if you're not sure about citing something, check with your instructor. plan your time carefully- often times students make careless mistakes when under pressure to complete a paper or assignment. further assistance owl purdue online writing lab \"there are few intellectual offenses more serious than plagiarism in academic and professional contexts. this resource offers advice on how to avoid plagiarism in your work. \" plagiarism : what it is and how to recognize and avoid it \"in college courses, we are continually engaged with other people\u2019s ideas: we read them in texts, hear them in lecture, discuss them in class, and incorporate them into our own writing. as a result, it is very important that we give credit where it is due. plagiarism is using others\u2019 ideas and words without clearly acknowledging the source of that information.\" updated: october 3, 2012 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Avoiding Plagiarism", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/help/LibraryInstructionalSupport.html"}, {"classification": ["Social Sciences", "Education"], "title": "Passionate Students Compassionate Healers -

& research a legacy a legacy of caring, education and research dean barbara hazard after 60 years the connell school of nursing at boston college (cson) has bestowed a legacy of caring, education and research to boston college and the nursing profession which extends beyond its boundaries and far into the future. the current dean of the school of nursing, dean barbara hazard, has solidified the contribution of the connell school of nursing to the profession, by embedding the pillars of caring and education into the firm rock of research. her publications on statistical methods for health research have confirmed this. the trend towards evidence-based nursing makes this approach even more valuable. nursing leaders have contributed to and have arisen from the cson. though space precludes the listing of all faculty and student accomplishments, it is hoped that all will see their contributions reflected in this brief summary. many of the nursing faculty publications are available through the boston college faculty publications catalog . marjory gordon , professor emeritus, developed nursing diagnosis and diagnostic reasoning in her \u201cmanual of nursing diagnosis: including all diagnostic categories approved by the north american nursing diagnosis association.\u201d nurses from all over the world come to learn from sister callista roy , resident nurse theorist, who developed the roy adaptation model. the first lelia holden carroll endowed professor is judith vessey whose groundbreaking work on the effect of chronic teasing and bullying on the psychological and physical health of children and adolescents is very relevant today. other nursing professors also research bullying and teasing, abuse or trauma, and other psych/mental health issues, notably ann burgess, angela amar, lois haggerty, carol hartman, danny willis, and barbara wolfe. additionally, judith shindul-rothschild is also an expert in health care policy and finance; nursing labor issues, staffing and quality of care, and managed care. ethics, which is a very strong component of the nursing curriculum, is currently the focus of research and practice for pamela grace . the relatively new field of nursing genetics is of interest to catherine read both for health promotion and education. ellen mahoney dorothy jones research involves development of the functional health pattern screening assessment tool (fhpsat) and evaluation of professional practice model; jane ashley , nursing care of the elderly; margaret laccetti , oncology clinical nurse specialist; jean o\u2019neil and nancy fairchild, ambulatory surgery and validation of nursing diagnoses; robin wood , breast cancer screening and early detection: intervention programs with high-risk populations (older and minority women). the new academic vice-president, cutberto garza , physician and scientist linked with both the biology department and the school of nursing, is noted for his research in pediatric nutrition. other faculty who focus their research and care on children and their families are s andy mott, michelle mendes, and katherine gregory . recently, june horowitz \u2019 research on post-partum depression garnered an award. other award winners and researchers in child/maternal health are joellen hawkins, mary aruda, and margaret murphy . community health programs include the bccson global health initiative (ghi), under the guidance of ronna krozy which evolved from a bc sponsored immersion trip to nicaragua for faculty and staff. additional faculty involved in community health are jennifer allen and susan kelly-weeder . faculty and graduate research are supported by professor mary duffy , director of the center for nursing research. the continuing education program is led by jean weyman . that the school of nursing is dynamically evolving is reflected in many of its recent initiatives. the master\u2019s entry program and the nurse teaching certificate had been spear-headed by associate deans loretta higgins and laurel eisenhauer respectively. the latter distance-education program is now directed by rita olivieri . the nurse anesthesia program, directed by susan emery and denise testa , is beginning its sixth year. a program in palliative care was developed by patricia tabloski , while pain management is a specialty of paul arnstein . also interested in palliative care is jane flanagan . the center for excellence in home care practice and education, a collaborative endeavor between the connell school of nursing and the visiting nurse association of boston, is directed by adele pike . an innovative approach to hiv education, \u201cwomen\u2019s voices women's lives,\" a culturally relevant hiv education/prevention film project, was developed by anne norris , rosanna demarco and chad minnich . joyce pulcini and judith vessey initiated the massachusetts school nurse research network to foster research among school nurses. \u2026we look back

and spiritual lives of boston college students, faculty, and staff by offering a remarkable range of speakers, artists, and performers. the direct forerunner of humanities series, the david b. steinman visiting poets series, ran in the 1957-1958 academic year and was administered by rev. francis w. sweeney, s.j. this series was made possible by a sizeable financial gift by engineer david steinman that enabled boston college to pay the lecture fees of ogden nash, robert frost, t.s. eliot and other speakers. the following year, the series was renamed the \u201chumanities series\u201d which reflected a broadening of the series\u2019 scope to include writers of disciplines other than poetry as well as other types of creative artists. over the years, speakers have included poets, novelists, dramatists, theologians, historians, classicists, and actors. in the 1960s, the university assumed the financial responsibility and gave father sweeney an annual budget to pay the lecturers\u2019 fees. in 1987, the lowell institution began contributing funds to the lecture series and they became formally known as the \u201clowell lectures.\u201d over the years, boston college has been exposed to an amazing range of talent, including twenty-two of the library of congress\u2019s poet laureate consultants and four nobel prize winners in literature, thanks to efforts of father sweeney and the humanities series. after four decades of service, father sweeney retired in 1998 as director of the humanities series and was succeeded by professor paul doherty who continues to provide successful leadership of what has become a cultural tradition on the heights. the exhibit includes additional information about father sweeney and professor doherty. the exhibit celebrates the first fifty years of the humanities series by showcasing works written by or about a selected number of speakers who visited boston college over the past five decades. while the exhibit\u2019s emphasis is on the lecturers, it should be remembered that the humanities series also offered a number of theater, music, and dance performances as well as art exhibits. the exhibit also includes photographs, letters, and other items from the university archives which document the history of the series. the books highlighted in the exhibit were selected in order to give a glimpse of the astonishing array of creative individuals who over the years have made the humanities series a consistently stimulating event. | next \u00bb maintained: university libraries \u00a9 2007 the trustees

and considered by some to be his best work. his writing style contained elements of realism, science fiction, fantasy, and satire. after his death, dinitia smith wrote \u201chis books were a mixture of fiction and autobiography in a vernacular voice, prone to one-sentence paragraphs, exclamation points and italics. . . . some critics said he had invented a new literary type, infusing the

the english they learned at school became the sonorous medium of his poetry and plays. omeros (the greek name for homer), arguably his best work, was published in 1990, two years before he won the nobel for literature. one critic compared the worknot with one of homer\u2019s poems, but with \u201covid's metamorphoses, with its panoply of characters, its seamless episodic structure, and its panoramic treatment of a mythic world both actual and legendary\u201d (michael heyward, washington post book world , november 11, 1990). considered by many to be the major poet of the caribbean, he was deeply concerned with the conflict between european and west indian cultures. both his plays and poetry display his mastery of creole vocabulary and calypso rhythms, and they are filled with rich evocations of caribbean and european landscapes. the watercolor on the book jacket is by walcott. __________________________________________________________ frederick wiseman (1930- ) film and

writers of the twentieth century, t. s. eliot had a wide-ranging and profound influence on modern literature. he was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1948. at the nobel banquet in december, 1948 eliot provided a stirring encomium on the importance of poetry in the world: in the work of every poet there will certainly be much that can only appeal to those who inhabit the same region, or speak the same language, as the poet. but nevertheless there is a meaning to the phrase \ufffdthe poetry of europe,\ufffd and even to the word \ufffdpoetry\ufffd the world over. i think that in poetry people of different countries and different languages--though it be apparently only through a small minority in any one country--acquire an understanding of each other which, however partial, is still essential. and i take the award of the nobel prize in literature, when it is given to a poet, to be primarily an assertion of the supra-national value of poetry. to make that affirmation, it is necessary from time to time to designate a poet: and i stand before you, not on my own merits, but as a symbol, for a time, of the significance of poetry. \ufffd previous | next \ufffd eliot's poetry

( berkhofer,1978, p.xvi.) current images of native americans have historical roots that emanated with columbus and continue to the present day. images that we see in film, the mass media, and popular culture are based on stereotypes that were developed by the colonizers. post-colonial theorists such as berkhofer postulate that these stereotypes have classified native americans as \u201cother\u201d to justify colonization and modern day public and private policies. persisting themes include the diversity of native american cultures treated as a single indian, generalizing from one tribe to all, viewing indians in terms of white ideals, and using moral evaluations to describe indians. modern examples of stereotypes include pocahontas, sports team mascots and names, and the aspects of counter culture movements that romanticize and appropriate native american culture. cultural appropriation is not always subtle or benign. in playing indian, philip deloria describes a non-indian group calling themselves the smoki who insisted for decades that they were designated to preserve the hopi snake dance in its proper form, against tribal protestations. in his autobiography, harley \u201cswiftdeer\u201d reagan claimed to be a medicine man and invented a \u201ctraditional cherokee ceremony\u201d of sexually initiating little girls. (garroutte, 2003, p.89-93.) while the utilization of indian themes in sports seems harmless to many, native americans have been fighting it for 30 years as demeaning. most states have sports teams with indian names including massachusetts. moline outlines the extensive nature of offensive imagery in \u201c american indian mascots in sports .\u201d \u201cthe chicago sun-times reports \u201c51 high schools in illinois offer war whoops and paint. there are redskins, indians, indianettes, injuns, blackhawks, comanches, braves, mohawks\u2026.\u201d (1999, p.179). in 2005, after decades of contention, the ncaa banned the use of offensive indian stereotypes for academic sports teams. recent article from indian country regarding the plans of college of william & mary to phase out indian feathers in its logo. however, there continues to be resistance to comply with the ruling. some universities have appealed the decision, most notably the university of illinois over \u201cchief illinek\u201d. these stereotypes and the battle to change them extend to the professional sports arena. in 1972 the cleveland indian center filed suit around the mascot of \u201cchief wahoo\u201d of the cleveland indians. the atlanta braves and the washington redskins retain their name to this day despite legal action canceling 7 registered redskins trademarks. (p.181.) going native, hundorf examines how the dynamics of colonization play out on a collective cultural level. as the violent history of the origin of america is denied, the origin story is constantly being replayed in an effort to maintain the cultural hegemony. in playing indian, philip deloria examines the ambiguity and malleability of meaning in white images of \u201cindians\u201d as it relates to american identities throughout history. he describes the colonists utilizing the image of \u201cindianess\u201d as the basis of american identity in rejection of british rule in the boston tea party, an iconic moment in u.s. history. a chorus of indian war whoops sounded outside the hall, and a party of what looked like indian men sprinted down the streets to the wharves. boarding the dartmouth and two other tea ships, the eleanor and the beaver, the indians \u201coverpowered\u201d the sympathetic guards and dumped tea into boston harbor for the next three hours. noone tried to stop the tea party, least of all the crowd of spectators gathered on the well lit wharf. when they had finished, the raiders cleaned up the ships, apologized to the guards for a broken lock, and went home to wash off their war paint. (1998, p.2) deloria posits that whites created the \u201cnoble savage\u201d and other \u201cgood indian\u201d stereotypes to develop a connection to their own vital primitive nature, and the land. indians represent affinity to the continent which they could impart to whites, yet to control the continent indians must be destroyed. thus there is movement back and forth between assimilation and destruction that the imagery reflects. he finds that the fluidity of meanings and contradictions represent conflicts within white cultures and identities. for more information, see the bibliography for images/stereotypes of native americans created for this exhibit. images courtesy of the authentic history center \u00ab back | next \u00bb [ learn our web : feedback : top of page ] maintained: university libraries \u00a9 2006 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Stereotypes", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/sites/libraries/exhibits/2006fall/"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "We Are Still Here -

to seize this once-in-a-century opportunity to celebrate boston's most influential writer; - for mayor thomas m. menino to declare january 2009 edgar allan poe month in boston and for governor deval patrick to declare january 2009 edgar allan poe month in the commonwealth of massachusetts; - for the city to make sure that its commemorative plaque is hanging in the right place; - to put a statue of poe on the common; - to add at least one raven to those swan boats! - and, while we're thinking about the common, to include a statue of nevermore along with jack, mack, nack, lack, etc. and change the name of the robert mccloskey classic to... make way for ducklings and the raven ! at bc, we intend to start a wave of poe appreciation and have heaps of fun in the process! be sure to check out the events to celebrate this bicentennial . \"the raven returns\" will be on display in the lobby of o'neill library until january 26, 2009. follow the links on the top of this page to enjoy some highlights of the exhibit. further information: paul lewis or katherine kim . updated: october 26, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "The Raven Returnsedgar Allan Poe Bicentennial Celebration", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "Passionate Students Compassionate Healers -

november 2010 in 1764, the english painter joshua reynolds and the writer and lexicographer samuel johnson formed what became the most famous intellectual fraternity of the day. they called it the literary club or simply \"the club.\" in its early years, members of the club met every monday for drink, dinner, and \"mental intercourse\" at the turk's head tavern on gerrard street in london's soho district. although there was no official president, johnson was the central authority of the club. as charles burney wrote in 1791, \"it was johnson's wish that our club should be composed of the heads of every liberal and literary profession, that we might not talk nonsense on any subject that might be started, but have somebody to refer to in our doubts and discussions, by whose science we might be enlightened.\u201d many of the club's initial members, including the playwright oliver goldsmith, were invited to join simply because they were johnson's friends. later, as membership expanded, admission was by unanimous vote. only those eminent in their fields -- be it literature, theatre, medicine, or the law -- were welcome. a single black ball in the ballot box was enough to exclude a candidate. over time, the club met at different venues in central london. the character of the group was already changing when samuel johnson died in 1784. politicians and members of parliament soon outnumbered men of letters. but its motto -- \"esto perpetua,\" latin for \"let it be perpetual\" -- proved prophetic. the club lasted well into the 20th century. about the image: the image presented above is an engraving by d. george thompson titled \"a literary party at sir joshua reynolds's,\" after an oil painting by james william edmund doyle. it was first printed by owen bailey in 1851, more than a half century after these men actually gathered. joshua reynolds was famous in his day for what his biographer called \"frequent, impromptu and unceremonious dinner-parties, where a dozen or a score were invited to a table prepared for half the number.\" thompson's engraving includes many members of \"the club,\" including its leader samuel johnson with pride of place at the head of the table, host reynolds at his left (holding an ear trumpet), and goldsmith at the far right. this exhibit was curated by christina lepri '10, now an intern at actors theatre of louisville; adeane bregman, bapst art librarian; and scott t. cummings, chair of the theatre department. it was designed by michael saldarriaga and michael swanson of media technology services, with help from frances bates, o'neill library. the thompson image is taken from a print in the collection of the boston athenaeum and is used by permission. learn more: read about \"the club\" from the oxford dictionary of national biography read about sir joshua reynolds from grove art online read about samuel johnson from the oxford dictionary of national biography see images from artstor find books about the play watch \"she stoops to conquer\", a co-production of the out of joint and national theatre companies of great britain 2003, from the theatre in video collection . view the 1773 printed copy of she stoops to conquer: or, the mistakes of a night. a comedy. as it is acted at the theatre-royal in covent-garden written by doctor goldsmith from the eighteenth century collections online . for further research see the guide for literary research . updated: november 8, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, And \"The Club\"", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Social Sciences", "Education"], "title": "University Libraries -

ways to do improve my paper without telling me what to say.\u201d \u201ci thought my paper was ready to turn in until i read the comments from my owl tutor. she helped me to do much better work.\u201d \u201cit is difficult to be a self-critic and i was having trouble finding ways to improve my essay. my owl tutor gave me some fantastic tips.\u201d \u201ci was at a dead end on how to proceed with my paper but now i know what direction to take.\u201d \u201cthe encouragement i received from my owl tutor meant a lot to me as i was struggling to do my paper.\u201d \u201ci couldn\u2019t believe how

parish life :: timeline :: the book :: more resources \"the catholic church has changed and contributed to the city for two centuries, influencing the life, the culture, and the institutions of the commonwealth,\" said thomas o\u2019connor. its legacy is rich; the future holds hope. introduction the popular book of essays, two centuries of faith: the influence of catholicism on boston: 1808-2008 , edited by university historian, thomas h. o\u2019connor, was presented as a gift to celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of the archdiocese of boston. the boston college libraries exhibit at o\u2019neill library* was inspired by the book. this site serves as an online extension of the exhibit, featuring additional images, video, and excerpts from the book. use this exhibit to explore the role of catholicism in boston over the past 200 years through four dramatic lenses: leadership , women in the church , diversity , and parish life . leadership from the church\u2019s early days of powerlessness and anti-catholic sentiment to the shaping of a \"triumphalist\" catholic sub-culture and a \"golden age\" for catholics under cardinal cushing, boston\u2019s catholic church and its leadership grew into an unquestioned force that influenced public policy with catholic moral values. follow the transitions of leadership within the archdiocese and view how the experiences of predecessors suggest new ways of approaching the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. women in the church the indelible impact of women both lay and religious was felt throughout the archdiocese as they took risks in defense of, and advocacy for, their catholic faith. their commitment to justice, the poor, education, and the church can be seen in images of their white-winged habits, their reaching hands, and their overflowing hearts. diversity the church in boston always had a distinctive irish flavor, but ethnic and racial minorities have always played an important role in the history of the archdiocese. as the archdiocese moves into the twenty-first century, leaders and the church\u2019s diverse followers will be called \"to study the social, demographic, and political changes that have taken place and assess their effects upon the traditional attitudes of the church. today, \"in the archdiocese of boston, mass is celebrated in over fifteen languages in dozens of churches\u2026a testament to its growing diversity and a reflection of the archdiocese\u2019s past.\" parish life from generation to generation, catholics have considered their parish to be a natural extension of their home and family. the parish was the place where catholics went dutifully to line up for confession on saturday afternoon in preparation for reception of holy communion at sunday mass. the parish was the place where catholics went to celebrate the defining moments of their lives: baptisms, weddings, and funerals. the parishes of boston have been peopled sometimes by saints, sometimes by sinners, and most times by men and women who tried their best to fulfill their daily commitments. *exhibit available for viewing at o'neill library, february 2 - may 1, 2010. see

libraries digital collections | boston college libraries the collection series listing bobbie hanvey using the collection about the project bobbie hanvey bobbie hanvey was born on october 31, 1945 in brookeborough, co. fermanagh, northern ireland to johnny and mary (n\u00e9e donnelly) hanvey. in his youth, hanvey began \u201crecording\u201d the people and events of his hometown using his father\u2019s camera and a tape recorder given to him by his father. johnny hanvey and the people of brookeborough have been profoundly influential on hanvey and his work. in 1966, hanvey took a job as a psychiatric nurse (which included musical therapy) at the downshire hospital, downpatrick. it was during his tenure there that hanvey\u2019s photographic instincts and skills were honed. when a charge nurse began recording home movies for the patients, hanvey assisted by taking still photographs. from the instruction of fellow nurses, books and practice, he learned the finer points of camera operation and how to develop and print his own negatives. by the early 1970s, hanvey was able to work full time as a general photographer. his early subjects included weddings, press items and even images for album covers. in the mid-1980s hanvey garnered three consecutive northern ireland provincial press photographer of the year awards and two northern ireland overall \u201cbest people picture\u201d awards. a photographer, writer and musician, bobbie hanvey continues to record people and life in northern ireland, both through his award-winning photography and through his long-running downtown radio program \u201cthe ramblin' man.\u201d his photographic work has been used by news services, published in two volumes, merely players (1999) and last days of the ruc-first days of the psni (2005) and featured in the irish century (published by weidenfeld and nicolson, 1998). he is also the author of the prose work, the mental , based on his experience as a psychiatric nurse. source: merely players . \u201cintroduction\u201d by brian turner, colourpoint books: newtownards, 1999. photo: bobbie hanvey interviewing group of travellers for his downtown radio program

place. note the comment below from a january 28, 2007 news story about the street (actually just an alley) supposedly named after poe in 1989. part of the chasm between poe and boston is physical\u2014the house where most scholars think he was born no longer stands; the plaque commemorating his birth on carver street, outside green's luggage shop at the fringe of the theater district, suggests his birthplace is now an alley full of trucks servicing the state transportation building. (on poe's birthday in 1989, that section of carver street was renamed poe way, but it appears even this gesture was ephemeral. the carver street signage remains today, and we could find no sign of poe way .) - the boston globe edgar allan poe never lived in one city for long, and ever since he died and was buried in baltimore in 1849, the city has claimed him as its own. cities duel over poe's remains (september 7, 2008) the one city that probably will never claim poe is boston . though he was born there, poe wrote disdainfully of the city's literary elite, and his birthplace does not

saturday afternoon in preparation for reception of holy communion at sunday mass. the parish was the place where catholics went to celebrate the defining moments of their lives: baptisms, weddings, and funerals. the parish was the place where a family could go to get help with the fuel bill so that an empty oil tank could be filled in time for winter. the parish was also the place where catholics went for scout meetings, cyo dances, adult socials, and parish bazaars. roman catholics are part of a universal church, but they experience church directly at the level of the parish. from generation to generation, catholics have considered their parish to be a natural extension of their home and family. \"'there is always something fascinating about the history of a catholic parish,' wrote the late archbishop joseph rummell of new orleans in 1948. \"usually modest and humble in its beginnings, it grows larger, more dignified, more efficient with the years. it is almost human in its development, and quite understandably so, for it is composed of vibrant human beings.' parishes are composed of human beings and are subject to all the faults and foibles of those human beings. the history of two hundred years of parish life in boston is certainly reflective of that premise. there have been times when the inconsistency and insecurity of human beings has impeded the growth of parishes as communities where the faith is received from earlier generations, lived on a daily basis, and then passed on to succeeding generations. the parishes of boston have been peopled sometimes by saints, sometimes by sinners, and most times by ordinary men and women who tried their best to fulfill their daily commitments.\" - william t. schmidt's essay, changing patterns of parish life .

seek answers to their questions. this colorful collection displays the myriad social, political, and spiritual issues that were reflective of the times. boy meets girl - the christian way the

churches, while smaller clusters of catholics from africa and the caribbean were also part of the early church. after world war ii, when the number of african americans in boston increased substantially, efforts by church leaders to assimilate black catholics into the archdiocesan structure were frustrated by the struggle over school desegregation during the 1960s and the bitter busing crises of the 1970s. by the 1980s however, changing demographics had begun to further transform the racial and ethnic makeup of the boston archdiocese, as immigrants began to arrive in great numbers,

she is. but it provides an umbrella under which to gather the many roles of women who were baptized into and lived the catholic faith outside of a religious order. the documents of vatican ii defined women religious as members of the laity, a change important in the consciousness of religious women. until the post vatican ii years, however, the lives of religious and laywomen ran typically on separate lines, and class issues sometimes led to differing interpretations of poverty and responsibility. the transformative incidents of the 1960s and the 1970s brought laywomen and religious women

institution, the catholic church is organized hierarchically, with clear lines of authority that have developed over centuries. the bishops and archbishops who have led the church in the greater boston area have had an enduring impact. not only did they make critical decisions concerning the parishes, schools, and social service agencies of the church, but most of them also served in their office for extended terms. boston\u2019s bishops have generally had very long tenures. the result has been an administrative and historical continuity for the local church more seamless than that of other places and institutions. in the two centuries since the first bishop was appointed in 1808, there have been just nine bishops and archbishops of boston. all were white males; all were celibate catholic priests. allowing for their particular circumstances, they all had a similar religious education and training, and their early priestly careers gave them many of the same experiences in serving the spiritual and other needs of catholic lay people. even so, each prelate had his own personality, his own strengths and weaknesses, and had to meet challenges that were peculiar to his own era. each had his own administrative and pastoral style and his own conception of what the job of a catholic bishop ought to be. looking at each one on his own terms opens the way to understanding each of them, but it also contributes to the formation of a collective view. the experiences of each may describe the past, but they also mark out a path to the future, as the church of boston faces new challenges in its third century. this excerpt, entitled \u201climited access\u201d traces the influence of catholic leadership on educational opportunities for women beginning in cardinal o\u2019connell\u2019s era.* \"leadership is critical in any organization. the organization's survival, its ability to accomplish its mission and to thrive through time, depends to no small degree on the individuals who assume the responsibility for overseeing it. they are not alone, of course. in large and complex organizations, many other people also contribute to the effort, and broad support and participation are no less essential than direction from the top. what might be called \"followership\" is just as important, and cooperation between leaders and those who are led will determine success or failure. but leaders have a special responsibility, and the decisions they make will therefore determine the character and the work of the larger whole. for this reason, the history of any organization can be understood by studying the succession of leaders and their relationship to those below.\" - james o'toole's essay, boston's catholics and their bishops: a comparative view . read

o\u2019connor. its legacy is rich; the future holds hope. introduction the popular book of essays, two centuries of faith: the influence of catholicism on boston: 1808-2008 , edited by university historian, thomas h. o\u2019connor, was presented as a gift to celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of the archdiocese of boston. the boston college libraries exhibit at o\u2019neill library* was inspired by the book. this site serves as an online extension of the exhibit, featuring additional images, video, and excerpts from the book. use this exhibit to explore the role of catholicism in boston over the past 200 years through four dramatic lenses: leadership , women in the church , diversity , and parish life . leadership from the church\u2019s early days of powerlessness and anti-catholic sentiment to the shaping of a \"triumphalist\" catholic sub-culture and a \"golden age\" for catholics under cardinal cushing, boston\u2019s catholic church and its leadership grew into an unquestioned force that influenced public policy with catholic moral values. follow the transitions of leadership within the archdiocese and view how the experiences of predecessors suggest new ways of approaching the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. women in the church the indelible impact of women both lay and religious was felt throughout the archdiocese as they took risks in defense of, and advocacy for, their catholic faith. their commitment to justice, the poor, education, and the church can be seen in images of their white-winged habits, their reaching hands, and their overflowing hearts. diversity the church in boston always had a distinctive irish flavor, but ethnic and racial minorities have always played an important role in the history of the archdiocese. as the archdiocese moves into the twenty-first century, leaders and the church\u2019s diverse followers will be called \"to study the social, demographic, and political changes that have taken place and assess their effects upon the traditional attitudes of the church. today, \"in the archdiocese of boston, mass is celebrated in over fifteen languages in dozens of churches\u2026a testament to its growing diversity and a reflection of the archdiocese\u2019s past.\" parish life from generation to generation, catholics have considered their parish to be a natural extension of their home and family. the parish was the place where catholics went dutifully to line up for confession on saturday afternoon in preparation for reception of holy communion at sunday mass. the parish was the place where catholics went to celebrate the defining moments of their lives: baptisms, weddings, and funerals. the parishes of boston have been peopled sometimes by saints, sometimes by sinners, and most times by men and women who tried their best to fulfill their daily commitments. *exhibit available for viewing at o'neill library, february 2 - may 1, 2010. see library hours . \u00a9 2010 boston

center > owl faq's writing assistance who can use the owl ? the owl is currently open to all members of the boston college community with valid bc e-mail addresses and usernames . submissions originating from other e-mail services (aol, yahoo!, etc.) cannot be honored. how much does the owl cost? like the in-person tutorial services offered at the connors family learning center, owl tutoring is completely free to eligible users. when is the owl available? the owl is open for business sunday through friday and follows the same calendar as the connors family learning center's in-person tutoring services. it is not available during the winter, spring, or summer breaks, nor is it available during periods officially designated as university holidays, and closes on the final day of undergraduate classes each semester. during regular business hours, owl submissions will be processed three times daily: at 10:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 6:00 pm . wait times for submissions received after a given process time will not begin until the subsequent processing time (e.g., if your paper arrives at 6:30 pm, it will not be processed--and your expected 48 hour waiting period will not begin--until 10:00 am the following day). please plan accordingly. what types of submissions can i get help with? the owl currently limits submissions in any discipline to 8 double-spaced pages or less . if you are working on a longer writing project, you may wish to send only a portion of your draft, or to break your essay into parts and submit them separately. long research papers, theses, and dissertations are not eligible, nor are assignments designated as \"take-home\" midterm or final writing examinations. we will, however, accept non-coursework related writing, such as cover letters and application essays. questions regarding dissertations and writing projects longer than 8 pages should be directed to sue barrett . how often can i use the owl? students are encouraged to submit to the owl as often as they like; however, we ask that students limit pending submissions to one at a time. in the event that multiple submissions are received simultaneously from a single user, they will be read in order of receipt, with each response processed only after the preceding ones have been completed and returned. who will be reading my submission? the owl, like the connors family learning center's in-person tutoring, is staffed by qualified graduate and undergraduate readers who have been trained to read and respond to the work of their peers both critically and constructively. what kind of feedback should i expect from my reader? in the same way that sending an e-mail differs from face-to-face conversation, on-line tutoring differs from in-person tutoring. rather than comment upon the sentence level, your owl tutor will emphasize broader, more global, conceptual and rhetorical issues . such comments may include affirmation of parts of your writing that work well, questions to consider as you revise, and advice about general ways of improving your work. your tutor may also offer you the opportunity to engage in an active dialogue about your writing in progress. sample feedback . what kind of feedback shouldn't i expect from my reader? the owl is not an editing or proofreading service . any requests for such services will result in your paper being returned to you exactly as it arrived. your tutor will not attempt to comment upon everything in your paper, and you should not assume that your paper is \"perfect\" after it has been read by a tutor. we believe that improvement is a gradual process achieved primarily by the writer, so you should expect to have to do additional work on your own. your tutor also will not evaluate your writing or predict a grade . finally, your owl tutor will comment upon your writing only insofar as it affects its subject content; our tutors are not subject experts , and will not attempt to provide subject area direction or clarification. sample feedback . how soon can i expect a response to my submission? any submissions received during regular owl business hours will typically generate responses within 48 hours. writers submitting during peak business periods (e.g., midterms, end-of-semester, etc.) may experience a wait time of as much as 72 hours. tagging your submissions with time-sensitive headings, such as \"urgent\" or \"asap\" or \"due tomorrow,\" will not expedite the process or generate special priority handling . always be sure to budget at least a three-day turnaround window between the date of your submission and its due date. updated: october 13, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal",

lyceum fiasco | lowell & poe | they love poe | poe & boston: 2009 1845: the lyceum fiasco! october 16, 1845: with lowell\u2019s support, poe is invited to speak at the boston lyceum. kept waiting for over two hours while the first lecturer drones on, poe reads not a new poem, as requested, but the interminable al aaraff , written in his adolescence. when boston reviewers decry his lack of tact, poe assails \u201cfrogpondians\u201d in general and insists that he was trying to hoax and insult them: to make \u201ca fuss.\u201d the hostile and snarky tone of these exchanges calls to mind the opening of poe\u2019s cask of amontillado (1846): \u201cthe thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as best i could, but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge.\u201d when the orator had concluded, an officer of the society introduced to the assembly a gentleman, who, as we understood him to say, possessed a raven-ous desire to be known as the author of a particular piece of poetry on a celebrated croaking bird. ...the audience listened in amazement to a singularly didactic exordium, and finally commenced the noisy expedient of removing from the hall, and this long before they had discovered the style of the measure, or whether it was rhythm or blank verse. we believe, however, it was a prose introductory to a poem on the \u201cstar discovered by tycho brahe,\u201d considered figuratively as the \u201cmessenger of the deity,\u201d out of which idea edgar a. poe had constructed a sentimental and imaginative poem. the audience now thinned so rapidly and made so much commotion in their departure that we lost the beauties of the composition. ...another small poem succeeded. this was \u201cthe raven\u201d \u2013 a composition probably better appreciated by its author than by his auditory... -cornelia m. walter, editor, boston evening transcript , october 17, 1845. in a series of articles published in november 1845, poe responded to the critical reviews of his lyceum lecture and put exclamation points on the boston-poe conflict: miss walters (the syren!) has seen cause, we find, to recant all the illnatured little insinuations she has been making against us (mere white lies\u2013she need not take them so much to heart) and is now overwhelming us with apologies\u2013things which we have never yet been able to withstand. she defends our poem on the ground of its being \u201cjuvenile,\u201d and we think the more of her defense because she herself has been juvenile so long as to be a judge of juvenility. well, upon the whole we must forgive her\u2013and do. say no more about it, you little darling! you are a delightful creature and your heart is in the right place\u2013would to heaven that we could always say the same thing of your wig!\" -poe's november 22, 1845 reaction to walters in the broadway journal we like boston. we were born there\u2013and perhaps it is just as well not to mention that we are heartily ashamed of the fact. the bostonians are very well in their way. their hotels are bad. their pumpkin pies are delicious. their poetry is not so good. their common is no common thing\u2013and the duck-pond might answer\u2013if its answer could be heard for the frogs. but with all these good qualities the bostonians have no soul. ...the bostonians are well-bred\u2013as very dull persons very generally are. -poe, the broadway journal , nov 1, 1845. \"never was a \u201cbobbery\u201d more delightful than that which we have just succeeded in \u201ckicking up\u201d all around about boston common. we never saw the frog-pondians so lively in our lives. they seem absolutely to be upon the point of waking up. in about nine days the puppies may get open their eyes. \"the poem, they say, is bad. we admit it. we insisted upon this fact in our prefatory remarks. ...we wrote it at ten years of age\u2013had it been worth even a pumpkin-pie undoubtedly we should not have \u201cdelivered\u201d it to them. \"in conclusion: the frogpondians may as well spare us their abuse. if we cared a fig for their wrath we should not first have insulted them to their teeth, and then subjected to their tender mercies a volume of our poems\u2014that, we think, is sufficiently clear. the fact is, we despise them and defy them (the transcendental vagabonds!) and they may all go to the devil together.\" -poe, the broadway journal , nov 22, 1845. \u201cwhat thoughts must have crossed poe\u2019s mind as he stood before this audience at the odeon theatre in boston? poe\u2019s feelings about boston were, at best, mixed. it was the place of his birth and was therefore associated lovingly in his memory with eliza; he had also lived there when he was in the army, and he had published his first book of poems there, identifying himself on the title page as a \u201cbostonian.\u201d but poe despised the literary coteries in boston and believed that american literature suffered from a new england bias. this view was of a piece with poe\u2019s southernness. he opposed the currents that threatened to sweep society toward total jacksonian democracy, just as when a student at the university of virginia he had sided more with john marshall\u2019s urbane, conservative thought and opposed jefferson\u2019s push for democracy and reform. poe also unequivocally associated boston with the transcendentalists (the frogpondians, as he derisively called them), emerson, thoreau, alcott, and others.\u201d -james m. hutchisson, poe , 2005 updated: october 25, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact |

the son of a truck-man and umbrella factory worker, the core of his political base was the immigrant, and ethnic, communities of new york city. he was reputed to be a progressive, and stood against

could be so contradictory of our whole history. nothing could be so false to the teaching of our divine lord himself. the world knows no greater mockery than the use of the blazing cross, the cross

james russell lowell & edgar allan poe two disasters rounded out what had initially promised to be poe\u2019s most successful year: the unsurprising demise of the broadway journal and a lecture in boston that turned into a public relations fiasco. still enjoying popularity as the author of \u201cthe raven,\u201d poe was in demand as a speaker. james russell lowell, at this point still admiring of poe, had arranged for him to read some of his poems before the venerable boston lyceum on 16 october 1845. - james m. hutchisson, poe , 2005 lowell's friendship with poe was not destined to good fortune. there had been mutal good-will and respect, with kindly offices, on both sides. the conncestion of poe with briggs in the editorial conduct of the broadway journal was the occasion of an exchange of views and facts between briggs and lowell which left poe's reputation very much impaired in lowell's judgement. poe's admiration for the \"author of 'rosaline,'\" on the other hand, did not survive the lines in \"the fable for critics\" in which his own portrait was not inaptly drawn; after briggs ceased to be his co-editor, poe attacked lowell as a plagiarist, and the latter expressed his resentment at length in a passage to be found in his published \"letters\"; lowell, too, had lately met poe just recovering from a spree, and the impression then received was sufficient of itself to terminate their relations. a short time after, in october, 1845, occurred to the public scandal of poe's visit to boston to read a poem before the boston lyceum, which confirmed him in his lifelong dislike of the bostonians. later, in an unpublished letter to mr. f w. thomas, early in 1849, poe denounced lowell with some contempt, and made a public disclosure of his changed attitude by an unfavorable review of \"the fable for critics,\" in the southern literary messenger, in february of that year. - the new york times , august 19, 1894 lowell on poe before the lyceum lecture mr. poe has that indescribable something which men have agreed to call genius. no man could ever tell us precisely what it is, and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power. let talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it has no such magnetism. - \u201cedgar allan poe,\u201d graham\u2019s magazine , february 1845 after the lyceum lecture there comes poe, with his raven, like barnaby rudge, three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge, who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters, in a way to make people of common-sense damn metres, who has written some things quite of their kind, but the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind. -\u201ca fable for critics,\u201d 1848 poe to and on lowell b efore the lyceum lecture letter, poe to lowell, november 1842: dr sir, learning your design of commencing a magazine, in boston, upon the first of january next, i take the liberty of asking whether some arrangement might not be made, by which i should become a regular contributor. i should be glad to furnish a short article each month\u2014of such character as might be suggested by yourself\u2014and upon such terms as you could afford \u201cin the beginning.\u201d that your success will be marked and permanent i will not doubt. at all events i sincerely wish you well; for no man in america has excited in me so much of admiration\u2014and, therefore, none so much of respect and esteem\u2014as the author of \u201crosaline\u201d. may i hope to hear from you at your leisure? in the meantime, believe me, most cordially yours, edgar allan poe after the lyceum lecture the \"fable [for critics]\" is essentially \"loose\"\u2014ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general. some good hints and some sparkling witticisms do not serve to compensate us for its rambling plot (if plot it can be called) and for the want of artistic finish so particularly noticeable throughout the work\u2014especially in its versification. in mr. lowell's prose efforts we have before observed a certain disjointedness, but never, until now, in his verse\u2014 and we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance. - \"james russell lowell,\" southern literary messenger , march 1849 updated: october 25, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9

college. in april of 1911, in an article in the catholic book bulletin: a monthly review of catholic literature entitled , \u201ca domestic library and other things,\u201d mrs. coleman offers advice to mr. o\u2019doherty of donegal and other persons seeking to set up a family library. mrs. coleman\u2019s recommendations are ones that seek to foster formation of the soul, mind, and heart, particularly for the catholic population in ireland. the titles and items featured in this exhibit reflect the recommendations of mrs. coleman. the items displayed here are fancier and of a much higher quality than the same titles or objects that would have appeared in the homes of the rural or urban working class irish in 1911. the selections, however, reveal the importance of the church and devotional practices, the study of irish history, literature, language, music, and other arts as the irish seek to reclaim all aspects of irish knowledge and culture and to begin to build a nation.

treatment are easily identified in the main holmes catalog by their course reserves location, but links to articles within online databases, scanned journal articles, or personal copies loaned by the professor can be found only in the course reserves catalog. the majority of materials scanned for reserve are owned by the boston college libraries. if necessary and appropriate, requested materials not owned will be purchased by the libraries. all materials placed on course reserves or accessed through the reserves system are solely for the non-commercial, educational use of students and researchers at boston college. network access is limited to authenticated boston college users with a username and password. there is no charge for access or use of course reserves materials. although reserves processing takes place at all libraries, physical reserve collections are located on the campus where the course is taught. o'neill library (including media) processes the reserve collections for the school of arts and sciences (except fine arts), education, management, nursing, and the woods college of advancing studies. the bapst art library, the social work library, the educational

joseph.herlihy.1@bc.edu ) or nora e. field, associate counsel ( nora.field@bc.edu ). library policies regarding use of copyright materials are based on current intellectual property law however, neither those policies nor the links to external resources included in this site constitute legal advice. use of copyrighted material for course reserves the libraries' policy for placing photocopied or scanned images of published copyrighted materials on course reserve is derived from the fair use provisions of the u.s. copyright act of 1976. in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use, the law outlines these factors to be considered: the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work course packets: when a large number of articles are needed for a course or when materials are restricted by copyright and require permission from the publisher before being placed on course reserve, course packs may be created as an alternative. the course pack coordinator at the bookstore will obtain permissions from individual publishers. once permissions are obtained the course packet will be sold at the bookstore like any other textbook for the convenience of students. public performance rights - o'neill library media center classroom policies for obtaining public performance rights for audiovisual material used in the classrooms are: face-to-face classroom instruction audiovisual materials may be used in room 211 as part of regular face-to-face classroom instruction without seeking the copyright owner's permission for performance or display. as such, the presence of a faculty member or teaching assistant is required at each class meeting/audiovisual showing in order to satisfy educational fair use conditions. use by groups or clubs groups, clubs and the like wishing to use audiovisual materials in room 211 must first obtain the public performance rights for those audiovisual materials from the copyright owner unless those rights were purchased along with said audiovisual materials -- often the case with institutional purchases from educational vendors (e.g. films for the humanities & sciences). individuals and groups can find assistance obtaining public performance rights by contacting contact media technology services\u2019 film rental specialist at 617-552-3242. another option for faculty to request classroom space is through student services. please see their website for policies and procedures. to confirm, or arrange for, screening equipment in classrooms other than o\u2019neill room 211, contact media technology services classroom support services . boston college policies and

family learning center > owl sample feedback writing assistance sample 1 dear rachel: i think you touch on some really nice ideas in this paper, which i'll talk about in a minute, but first i want to address one general concern i had about your writing. you have a tendency to spend too much time summarizing the plot--this is time when you could be advancing your argument. you don't need to tell your reader what happens in the story; you can assume that he or she already knows. for example, look at this paragraph: [...] everything that i've noted with square brackets is plot summary. the sentence that begins \"feeling rejected, the creature wanders away...\" is borderline because you're making a judgment about the creature's motivations, but in general you shouldn't spend time repeating the events of the story. the second part of this paragraph is much better in that you're talking about motivations and making arguments. i think you've got some really interesting ideas in this paper, particularly in your fifth and sixth paragraphs, but you need to expand upon them. for example, you might spend more time talking about millhauser's rationale--why does he think the monster should have been presented as a brutal beast throughout? what would be lost in such a presentation? why is it better that shelley shows the monster in terms of growth and progression? you introduce this idea in your introduction, arguing that shelley is deliberately playing with the reader's sympathies, for the monster and for frankenstein. could you say more about how she does this? what is the effect of the reader's divided sympathies? where does the sympathy lie at the end of the book? why might shelley be interested in this? in general, what is the value of making the creature sympathetic? i hope you found some of the questions i've raised valuable. you've touched on some interesting issues in this paper, and there is definitely plenty of room for you to develop them even further. if you have any questions about anything i've said, or any further questions, please feel free to write back to me. good luck with your paper and thank you for submitting to the owl! sample 2 mark, thank you for submitting your paper to the owl; i am a political science major and very much enjoyed reading it. below you will find a few suggestions for how to strengthen your writing during the revision process. you wrote that your major concerns with your paper were \"abstract prose\" and \"elementary points.\" i did not find your arguments to be too simplistic or \"elementary,\" nor did your language seem too abstract. it did, however, lack clarity and definition at some points. specifically, there are some concepts that you repeat throughout your paper but never define. one is the \"republican role.\" it may be that your instructor discussed this idea at length in class, or that machiavelli does in his discourses on livy, but there is no such discussion in your paper. a stronger paper would define the proper role of a leader in a republican state from the beginning. some theoretical questions you may want to consider on this point include: what is the difference between a republican leader and a tyrannical leader? how can one distinguish between the two? why is it important to prevent against tyranny? is the leader subservient to the will of the people? is the leader responsible to anyone? where does the leader draw his power or right to govern from? what does it mean to \"be subordinate to a republican role\"? what qualities are valuable in a leader? which ones are dangerous? it may be beneficial to read over your paper with a critical eye looking for vague concepts. what ideas do you reference but never fully explain? do you take certain concepts for granted? if you find such problems, generating a list of questions to focus your idea (as above) can be a helpful exercise. there were two more areas i found especially lacking in definition: the concept of tyranny and a \"short time in office.\" thank you again for submitting your paper to the owl. your arguments are strong and i hope my comments will help to fine-tune your essay. please feel free to e-mail me for further assistance or clarification. good luck with your revisions! sample 3 richard, thanks for submitting your essay-i enjoyed reading it. i hope my comments help you in your revision process. your personal narrative is without a doubt at its best when you give vivid details of the day from your perspective, which is, as you describe, a very unique one. the \"chalky taste\" of the air, for instance, is a detail that really brings the scene to life. you asked for help with structure, and i think the most sensible structure in this case is a chronological one. it's fine to start with a vivid scene to land the reader in the event, but then it makes sense to step back and tell the story as it happened. to help you accomplish this end, you might consider listing each of the major points you want to cover and then turning them into an outline. it might help, too, to think about the overall message you want to convey. then make sure all of your details contribute to that message. as for constructive comments, you never really explain why you were at ground zero on september 12. do you just happen to live nearby? did you have any special connection to the firefighters or the victims? why did you decide to help out? i would also be careful of the very general statements you use to sum up the essay, such as , \"that day brought to my attention a side of humanity that had lay dormant in my mind. that moment in time showed me that people have the capacity to act unselfishly.\" it's best to convey your point through examples rather than summation-the old advice to \"show not tell.\" it takes a lot of courage to tackle in an essay the events of september 11 and the days following, but i think you have a great perspective, and the ability to look beyond the chaos to the details of the scene. feel free to write back as you revise this piece. i'd be glad to talk more about it. sample 4 hello, angela, the second point is that you might want to explain in greater detail how subjective experiences shape the need for a group such as ahana. you mention that racial and cultural differences do exist and that the \"differing perspectives caused by these distinctions exist regardless of whether they are acknowledged.\" this is a very integral part of your argument, so maybe developing it further would be helpful. i realize it's a very broad concept to try and condense within your paper, but focusing on explicating that part might be helpful. overall, i think you have a very strong paper that seems to fulfill the parameters of the assignment quite well. updated: october 13, 2010 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle":

on exhibit illustration: detail of the cover of the new nick carter weekly, no. 499, july 21, 1906 in the late 1800s it was discovered that cheaply printed, serially published stories with snazzy, color covers \u2013 which could be mailed at a steep discount and were particularly marketed to young men \u2013 would sell like hotcakes at 5\u00a2 each. and, although they were considered by responsible-type people to be a waste of time and money (and a terrible influence on the morals of those who read them) they flourished until postal rates changed\u2026..and 5\u00a2 could get a kid into the movies instead. the dime novels of the burns library include only a small fraction of the myriad series issued by publishers frank tousey and street & smith of new york. six series are represented here. all are in the category \u201cnickel weeklies\u201d. authors of nickel weeklies were identified by pen names and each pen name could be used by numerous authors. the creators of the wonderful cover illustrations are not identified. the social biases and stereotypical beliefs of many americans at the turn of the twentieth century are on painfully full view in both cover and text. national ideals of self-reliance, loyalty, ingenuity, bravery and patriotism are here as well. jack wright - the boy inventor - appeared in the frank tousey series \u201cpluck & luck: complete stories of adventure\u201d from 1891-1904. all 120 stories featuring jack were authored by luis senarens (1863-1939) writing as \u201cnoname.\u201d jack is one of the \u201cedisonade\u201d heroes of dime novels. his incredible inventions are vehicles he uses to access every part of the globe. from his murdered father, mad bill, jack has inherited an obsession with exploration of the ocean floor, and he has earned a fortune through his adventures. his sidekicks are timothy topstay and fritz schneider. the series is considered an early example of the science fiction genre, and its connection to the steampunk aesthetic is clear. on their ship, the red raven , thad fergus and his pals oliver and simon battle pirate after pirate after pirate. foes include blackbeard, morgan, kidd, and others. \u201cthe red raven library: stirring tales of old buccaneer days\u201d was published in 1905. the pen name \u201can old salt\u201d was used by authors thomas c. harbaugh (1849-1924) and john demorgan (1848-1926). \u201cthe red raven library\u201d was published by the winner company, an imprint of street & smith, new york. \u201cthe red raven library\u201d was continued by \u201cpaul jones weekly:

great ceremony to the united states from an obscure burial location in paris. \u201cpaul jones weekly\u201d was published by the winner company, an imprint of street & smith, new york. \u201cthe

and his partners harry brady (no relation) and alice montgomery. the location of the action can be almost anywhere, but the series is especially known for its scenes of new york city and the chinatown neighborhoods of both new york and san francisco. the nickel weeklies exhibited here are typical examples, with color covers and 28-32 double-column pages of text per issue. the text is printed on cheaply produced, acidic, pulp paper which is deteriorating at a fast rate. the magazines are quite fragile but may be used with care at the burns library. they are held off-site and must be requested

burns library, ford tower, boston college, june 07-august 30, 2013 thomas merton, the famed trappist monk, had begun corresponding with father francis sweeney, s.j. before his best-selling autobiography, the seven storey mountain , captivated the nation. merton gave the typescript of the autobiography to sweeney, beginning a fruitful collaboration between himself and boston college. librarians, father terence connolly, s.j. and father brendan connolly, s.j. quickly accumulated a thomas merton collection for boston college by agreeing to loan merton research materials in exchange for signed copies of merton\u2019s publications. this was the beginning of the merton collection, which continues to grow and now includes drawings by merton, photographic images, and correspondence. the exhibit, currently showing in the john j. burns library, explores both the 1949 exhibit that celebrated the acquisition of the seven storey mountain typescript and merton\u2019s correspondence with these three boston college jesuits. this exhibit represents just a small part of the thomas merton collection. please visit the john j. burns library to view more of the collection. look at our

immigration, crime, social welfare, culture: how did nineteenth-century bostonians shape and respond, alone and together, to the changing urban landscape? this exhibit explores personal and collective responses to a city swept first by immigrants, then by fire, forced to reinvent itself as a both physical and social space. on display are a selection of print and manuscript documents representing individual, institutional, and governmental responses to the challenges and opportunities presented by life in a dense, diverse, and growing city. the exhibit features diaries of 19th-century citizens, theatre broadsides and scrapbooks, the published reports of social service agencies concerned with health and welfare, records kept by the boston police department, immigrant financial records, and images of the great fire of 1872. building the urban landscape \u2013 with bricks and mortar, and with services and organizations \u2013 left a documentary trail in libraries and archives throughout the region. boston college, now celebrating its sesquicentennial, was collecting boston material from its beginnings in the south end. the burns library historical bostoniana collection also owes much to the generosity and foresight of two donors: ellerton j. brehaut (d. 1985), an avid collector and proud promoter of boston who served at the boston chamber of commerce from 1919 to 1959, witnessing enormous changes in the city, and john t. and ruth m. galvin, who established an endowment for the acquisition material documenting boston political history. about the gallery you can

sociology collection supports teaching and undergraduate and graduate research needs of both faculty and students in the sociology department and the entire university community. the collection is strong in social theory, methodology, social organization, social structure and data and social psychology. the collection mirrors the development and transformation of american sociology from the dominance of the chicago school of sociology to a broader, changing discipline today. areas of collection strength include social policy, social economy, and social justice. the collection is rich in material on political sociology and social movements, social change and policy planning, criminology, deviance and social control, race and ethnic relations, social psychology, community and family, social stratification, religion and society, medical sociology, complex organizations, and social problems of the economy. the library still collects very broadly to keep current with research trends and demands. the collection includes broad areas such as gender, race, class, health care and medical sociology, development sociology of emerging nations, globalization, social movements, inequality in society such as labor, race and ethnicity. the library acquires material on major institutional and organizational settings such as professions, jobs and work, environment and organizations, political sociology, trends in family sociology, sociology of education, sociology of religion, sociology of science, sport, mass media institutions, social process and change, which includes spatial processes, deviance and social control. a strong philosophy collection further expands the resources available for sociology study and research. | view selected resources \u00bb recent additions to the collection | view more ... interdisciplinary elements of the subject area frequently the subject areas of this collection relate to history (social history, popular culture), philosophy, psychology, political science, economics, business management, nursing and health sciences, education, gender and women's studies, international and cross cultural studies. formats and types of materials although half of the collection is in print format, materials are collected in other formats such as electronic, dvds, microforms, audiovisuals and datafiles. since boston college is a member of icpsr (interuniversity consortium for political and social research) , and subscribes to roper center for public opinion research database it is positioned to provide numerous datafiles to researchers. the library collects research level monographs and serials in print and microformats. reference sources (indexes and abstracts, dictionaries, handbooks, statistical sources, book catalogs, bibliographies ) in paper, electronic access to full text articles, or microform format are purchased extensively. since boston college is a u.s. government depository library, it collects or provides electronic access to all relevant government documents, technical reports, and annual reports. proceedings of symposia, international congresses, etc. are collected broadly. dissertations and theses - full text (proquest) database provides access to theses and dissertations. the full text of dissertations published since 1997 is also available for download. for the most part, the library does not acquire textbooks for any given courses. yet some textbooks are valuable as reference and research works. in such cases, the library will acquire these selectively upon request. the collection has been strengthened by faculty gifts from prominent sociologists: lewis a. coser, everett c. hughes, and benedict s. alper. manuscripts and rare items are housed in the john j. burns library of rare books and special collections and for the most part the donor's books are housed in the o'neill library circulating collection. languages english is the primary language of the collection although some material is acquired in other languages including french, german and spanish. geographic area coverage the primary focus is on the united states. since the beginning of this century, the chicago school has dominated american sociology. sociology materials on social conditions will be covered in the policies of history and political science. interest in european (french, british and german) schools of thought and research centers has emerged in the theoretical areas of sociology. in addition, latin american, african, and asian sources are collected. time periods the primary emphasis of the collection is twentieth century materials, with purchases of significant nineteenth century works made whenever possible as the budget permits. dates of publication emphasis is on acquiring current material published after 1960. selective retrospective purchasing is carried out and may involve reprints, microform or electronic access rather than the original format. updated:

documentary series, and also a strong collection of periodicals. the collection supports advanced study in the areas of american politics, comparative politics, international politics and political theory. the strongest area of emphasis in both the graduate program and in the collection is political philosophy, with emphasis on greek, german, english and french political philosophy. american politics remains strong, and strength in the area of the judiciary has grown alongside of earlier emphases on the political institutions of the presidency and congress. supporting this area are the papers of thomas p. o'neill, jr., the rev. robert f. drinan, s.j., edward boland and margaret heckler in the congressional archives of the john j. burns library . the o'neill chair in american politics has strengthened teaching in that area. there has been a recent growth in emphasis on public policy, especially dealing with environment and health. the collection also supports the research of the many students who are attracted to international politics at the m.a. level. there is also interest in political history. east asian and latin american politics are additional areas of growing emphasis. approval plans for the major european languages support research. electronic indexes and full text databases are playing an increasingly important role in collections. | view selected

research needs for students and faculty across the curriculum. gender studies, a field of interdisciplinary study which analyzes the phenomenon and the significance of gender, is sometimes related to studies of class, race, ethnicity and location. the two areas included within the gender studies collection are women studies and glbt studies. the major portion of the gender studies collection supports teaching and research needs for students and faculty in the women\u2019s studies program . the primary focus of the collection is the study of women in the united states. the collection areas are the history of women in the united states, and current research and discourse carried out in the social sciences and women\u2019s studies. other areas include women in theology, feminist philosophy, nursing, education and women in the sciences. a secondary focus is women and women\u2019s studies outside the united states, such as french feminism. the history and political science collections are strong in documenting and analyzing the experience of women in the united states by covering early women's rights, suffrage, social causes, reform and the women's movement. the collection includes diaries, biographies and autobiographies of their life and work. with the women's movement and the struggle to ratify the equal rights amendment in the 1960's and 1970's, the social sciences collections have grown to reflect social movement, social activism, gender, and role research. the women\u2019s studies program offers an interdisciplinary minor to undergraduates and places emphasis on the study of women's past and present position in society, analyzing the differences among women as a result of such factors as race, class, religion, and sexuality; the concept of gender relations is also an important emphasis. the range of issues that intersect with gender such as nationalism and post colonialism, health, labor, sexuality, race, family work and welfare are additional aspects that are studied. the collection mirrors and supports these concerns by providing current teaching and research materials in many formats, including electronic access. view selected

and therefore a subject of study in many disciplines. this is evident in the titles of such scholarly journals as health communication, political communication, science communication, management communication quarterly, education, communication & information , journal of communication and religion, and others, and also in articles in more general publications in these disciplines. second, the study of different aspects of communication involves perspectives, approaches, theories, and ideas from many other disciplines, including psychology, sociology, political science, literature, linguistics, women's studies, and others. freedom of speech and other issues are widely covered in legal sources; information about media industries is found in business sources. databases and indexes in all of these subject areas are used regularly to find journal literature in communication, and major communication databases include many articles of relevance to these subjects. formats and types of materials formats collected include print, electronic, microform, and audiovisual. types of materials include monographs, serials, videos and dvds, and reference works including major indexes, abstracts, catalogs, bibliographies, yearbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, research guides, and directories. languages english is the primary language of the collection. geographic area coverage the united states has been the primary area of focus, with growing interest in the globalization of media, intercultural communication, and other aspects of communication beyond the borders of the u.s. time periods mass communication is a relatively young field; therefore, works from the twentieth century forward are the primary focus of the collection. date of publication emphasis is on current

education collection in o'neill library and the k-12 curriculum collection in the educational resource center . education collection, o'neill library brendan a. rapple education bibliographer 617-552-4482 rappleb@bc.edu collection overview the primary purpose of the education collection is to support the teaching and research of the discipline of education. the diverse clientele served include lynch school of education faculty and students, other b.c. faculty and students, b.c. staff, others from the b.c. community, visiting scholars and students, and other members of the general public. it is a major goal of the collection to serve the courses taught by the lynch school of education and the research needs of the faculty and students. a principal focus of the collection is on educational materials pertaining to the u.s. however, there is substantial collecting in educational theory and practice of other nations. the primary emphasis of the collection is research based with significant additional holdings in educational practice. principal subject areas covered include counseling psychology, developmental psychology, educational psychology, human development, curriculum and instruction, teaching and learning strategies, educational administration, special education, early childhood education, elementary education, secondary education, higher education, educational research, reading and language arts education, history and philosophy of education, sociology of education, comparative and international education, anthropology of education, multicultural education, classroom assessment, supervision, educational testing, measurement and evaluation, educational technology, computers and education. the nature of the discipline of education determines that most materials are monographs. clearly a large number of journal subscriptions is also essential. several years ago o'neill library greatly increased its subscriptions to education journals. though it is anticipated that the number of journals added in the near future will not be as great, new journal subscriptions will continue to be made as appropriate. the increasing focus on collecting in electronic format is discussed in formats and types of materials below. for collections in the educational resource center , view the ek-12 curriculum collection below. | view selected resources

... interdisciplinary elements of subject area because education is a field that encompasses so many other disciplines, the interdisciplinary elements of the collection are numerous. the education collection is enhanced by our holdings in psychology, sociology, philosophy, history, religion, anthropology, literature, biology, health sciences, architecture, and other areas. though particular emphasis is naturally placed on collecting materials that are catalogued with the library of congress call number \"l\", appropriate education related works with other call numbers are also purchased. formats and types of materials most of the monographs, serials, and reference works of the education collection continue to be in print on paper format. collecting decisions regarding edition, imprint, and whether hardback or paperback depend on intellectual appropriateness, availability, durability and affordability. libraries are naturally inextricably linked with the world of publishing. while much of the latter is still vitally concerned with the traditional world of print, its electronic nature is growing at a tremendous rate. publishing's utilization of technology\u2019s continually evolving capabilities is contributing to an inexorable change in research, especially due to the thriving improvements in data manipulation, not just of text but of images, sound, and videos. complementing innovative production types of electronic research activity are new models of digital scholarly publishing that are ensuring that the dissemination of research findings electronically will increasingly be the norm. accordingly, as o'neill becomes increasingly a digital library, particular focus is being placed on collecting and providing access to electronic materials. current full-text electronic periodicals in education and related subjects continue to be acquired. relevant electronic bibliographic citation databases are also obtained. the library is also purchasing a growing number of important multidisciplinary full-text databases that are valuable for much educational research. retrospective collection of periodicals are increasingly in electronic format. the education collection also includes selected videos, films, sound recordings and other media pertaining to aspects of education. dissertations and theses completed at other institutions are selectively purchased depending on the particular research needs of lynch school of education faculty and graduate students. however, the library also provides the ability to download the full text of most dissertations completed at boston college and elsewhere since 1997 through the database proquest dissertations and theses - full text . o'neill library purchases very few curriculum materials: games, elementary or secondary textbooks, individual tests, workbooks, curriculum guides (however, consult the educational resource center collection below for its collecting in these areas). graduate textbooks are included in the collection if they are significant and make a major contribution to a particular area of education. languages most of the material collected is in the english language. however, important critical works on educational theory and practice in french, spanish, german and other european languages are also added to the collection. preference is given to english translations, when available, of these foreign language works. geographic areas (subject approach) the education of the united states constitutes the primary focus of the collection. the majority of the materials purchased concern aspects of american education. however, there is an increasing collecting emphasis on comparative and international education. selective materials on education in ireland, britain, canada, australia, new zealand, and other anglophone nations are increasingly purchased, as are educational works pertaining to continental europe, central and south america, africa, and asia. while the educational serial collection also focuses primarily on u.s. publications, more and more foreign serials, especially british, canadian, and australian, are subscribed to. time periods (subject approach) primary focus is centered on up-to-date material on current theories and practices in education. however, there is significant purchasing of works dealing with earlier periods, particularly of works concerned with foundational aspects of education, e.g. philosophy of education, sociology of education, history of education, anthropology of education, intercultural education etc. date of publication current monographs and current serials are the materials most in demand in the field of education. consequently, particular focus is placed on collecting up-to-date works. nevertheless, in order to better serve the research needs of our faculty and graduate students there is also need for substantial retrospective collecting. materials published in the united states since 1860 and published elsewhere since 1800 are eligible for collection. earlier materials are judged for appropriateness for burns library. when collecting retrospective materials or replacing missing or deteriorated materials, formats with a long expected life, such as reprints on acid-free paper or microforms, are sought. increasingly, appropriate retrospective materials are in electronic format. k-12 curriculum collection, educational resource center margaret cohen head librarian, educational resource center 617-552-4919 cohenlm@bc.edu collection overview the educational resource center serves the specialized resource needs of the lynch school of education students and faculty. the collections include children's books, fiction and non-fiction, curriculum and instructional materials, print and non-print, educational and psychological tests, and educational software intended for elementary and secondary school instruction. these materials are unique to the needs of the lynch school of education and do not duplicate materials found in the o'neill library. | view selected resources \u00bb recent additions to the collection

meets the needs and requirements of research and teaching faculty in the physics department , graduate (doctoral and master's) and undergraduate students, and the general interests of the boston college community. research in the physics department revolves around two themes: theoretical and experimental. theoretical research covers plasma instabilities in lower dimensional solid state systems; nanostructures and quantum dots for ultrafast computing; collective phenomena at surfaces of solids; theory of high temperature superconductivity; fermi liquid theory; strongly correlated electron systems; computational physics; theory of novel electron materials; quantum hall effect; heavy fermion compounds; quantum magnetism and electronic transport in high magnetic fields; thermoelectric transport in novel semiconductor materials; theory of strongly coupled coulomb systems; space and atmospheric physics, among other areas. experimental research covers scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy on novel electronic materials; strongly correlated electron systems; materials physics; single crystal growth, film deposition, and bulk processing of high temperature superconducting materials; processing and physics of giant magnetoresistive materials; synthesis and characterization of superhard materials; low temperature condensed matter physics; materials in strong magnetic fields, nanostructured superconductors, heavy fermion superconductors; thermoelectric materials; physics and chemistry of quasi one and quasi two dimensional electron systems; low temperature, high magnetic field electrical and magnetic properties of organic conductors and superconductors, anisotropic torque and magnetotransport measurements; commensurability resonances and spin density wave states; solid state spectroscopy of laser-type materials, luminescence spectroscopy, flash photolysis and molecular spectroscopy, photoacoustics, femtospectroscopy; optical properties of low-dimensional and organic semiconductors; modulation spectroscopy, among other areas. journals and conference proceedings constitute the bulk of our current collections strength. more

collection development. time periods (subject approach) current developments in physics are emphasized. dates of publication materials published recently are collected. older titles are acquired on demand. weeding as with selecting new titles for the libraries\u2019 collections, decisions to discard items are made within the context of the libraries\u2019 collection development policies. a properly weeded collection will have only material needed for current and future research and study at boston college. while the needs of future researchers are often difficult to predict, efforts will be made to keep materials with lasting and potential value for academic programs at boston college. like new book and journal selection, careful and selective weeding will improve the quality of a collection and increase the probability that researchers will find useful material. the following criteria will be used to determine which materials to discard: superseded reference materials with no historical value. duplicate copies of little-used materials. outdated content without significant research value. materials in poor physical condition which cannot be saved for future use by any preservation method appropriate for its research value and need not be replaced. materials that do not support the university\u2019s current and future teaching and research. subject areas collected

department of earth and environmental sciences , the graduate and undergraduate students, the weston campus, and the general interests of the boston college community. research in the earth and environmental sciences department revolves around geochemical cycles, sediment transport in coastal environments, geophysical hydrology, seismicity (the causes of earthquakes and the structure of the crust and mantle in the northeastern united states- the weston observatory operates a regional seismic network for new england and vicinity), geographic information system (management, research, and development of database for the geological bedrock map of massachusetts), geochemistry, rock mechanics, experimental sedimentation, structural geology, and paleontology. journals and monographs, the united states geological survey and other governmentally produced materials in print, cd, map and electronic formats form the bulk of our current collections strength. more and more of our journals are being made available electronically to our users. resource sharing in the form of membership in regional and national organizations like the boston library consortium will increasingly play a significant role in collection development. as access to resources and document delivery become easier and faster due to advances in technology, we will depend more and more on interlibrary loan,

organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physical and theoretical chemistry. these works may be descriptive treatments of a particular element or class of chemicals, studies of reactions by type, or physical and theoretical studies of chemical properties or phenomena. the extremely active research focus of the department, as evidenced by an extensive list of faculty publications, and the nature of contemporary chemical research require the provision of print and electronic resources that allow the chemist to be alerted to the most current international research on a weekly or even daily basis. delivery of information in electronic format is a given in chemistry. the major chemistry and interdisciplinary science indexes and abstracts are crucial to constantly alert researchers to the newest journal articles, patents, and technical reports. databases which provide graphical structure and reaction search capabilities are particularly important in certain areas of chemical research. electronic journals are the next area of major collection growth. increasingly, faculty are requesting that long standing major chemistry journals and new chemistry journal subscriptions be available in both formats. chemistry faculty and students prefer to access as much material as possible in electronic format via their computer desktop. most undergraduate students in the program also conduct independent research within a research group. as a result of this activity, most undergraduate students read publications that are at the same level of complexity as those read by graduate students

languages and literatures , and by other university library patrons, including members of the bc community, visiting scholars and the general public. in addition to the literatures of italy, spain and france, the library aggressively collects major works by the hispanic authors of the americas, and the francophone authors of europe, canada, africa and asia. past and current literary theory and criticism is also actively collected. another important area of concentration is cultural studies (including social, political, and linguistic history) of the areas in which these languages are used. scholarly works on the romance languages (e.g., philology, linguistics) are collected, but language textbooks and language-learning software are not. requests for textbooks to be placed on reserve are handled by course reserves , and language acquisition materials are available in the bc language laboratory . no limitations of literary genre are imposed. conference papers and dissertations are purchased only upon request, when a need is clearly demonstrated. visual media (including feature films) are purchased and shelved in o'neill's media center. acquisitions in romance languages and

sociology, psychology, political science, economics and education. formats and types of materials materials in the romance languages and literatures collection are largely in print format, although periodicals are increasingly purchased in electronic format, and full-text databases are providing access to both primary source and critical materials. currently, electronic monographs (e-books) related to rll study consist almost entirely of reference works (e.g., cambridge guides/companions). it is anticipated that this trend toward online access will continue and grow, and e-books will eventually become an important element in the collection. languages great emphasis is given to collecting literary works in their original languages. (english translations of major works may be purchased by the specialist for english and american literature.) critical and theoretical works are collected primarily in french, spanish, italian, english, and selectively in other languages. at faculty request, the library is building a collection in proven\u00e7al, and medieval italian and spanish works as they are reprinted and made available. geographic areas although romance culture has by tradition been traced to a european source, the course offerings of the department also take into account the presence of hispanophone, and francophone cultures in the caribbean, south and central america, africa and asia. thus, the library's collection is not limited to france, spain and italy, but strives to represent francophone and hispanophone cultures by inclusion of their major authors. time periods the primary strength of the course offerings in romance literatures is the early modern era (roughly 1500-1800), and this period is the main focus of acquisitions activity for the library's collection. literary works dated from 1800 through the present, and as mentioned above, medieval works in proven\u00e7al, italian and spanish are also actively collected. no chronological limitations are placed on works of literary theory and criticism. date of publication current imprints are preferred due to preservation concerns. modern editions of classics as well as reprints of significant works are also emphasized. when collecting retrospective materials or replacing missing or deteriorated materials, formats with a long expected life, such as reprints on acid-free paper or microforms, are sought. increasingly, appropriate retrospective materials are in electronic format. deselection the quality of the collection is maintained through a continual evaluation of resources in order to identify for withdrawal items that are no longer useful. typically, the following categories of materials will be subject to weeding:

number of faculty research areas are also taken into consideration in collection building. in russian, they include such areas as classical and modern russian poetry, jews in russian literature, nabokov, the teaching of russian, and the south slavic area. in linguistics, faculty research areas include general and historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, semantics, syntactic theory, teaching english as a foreign language, theories of language learning in historical perspective, liturgical language, morphology, morphophoemics of ancient languages, poetics and poetic theory, and areas which can be related to language such as music and mathematics. in chinese they include modern writers, chinese dialects, methods of teaching chinese, and the cultural

> libraries > libraries & collections > by subject > music collection sonia ensins music bibliographer 617-552-2414 ensins@bc.edu collection overview development of the music collection follows the research and teaching needs of the music department the college of arts & sciences confers the academic degree of a bachelors of arts (b.a.) with a major in music. the department offers courses in western and non-western music which cover history, theory, composition, and performance in order to educate both musiciansand listeners, majors and non-majors. consequently, the department's curriculum requires a collection that has been developed within a broad liberal arts framework. the music collection has interdisciplinary aspects and also relies on strengths in other collections. | view selected resources \u00bb recent additions to the collection <noscript><a href=\"http://library.bc.edu/services/rss/html/music.html\">click for new additions to the music collection</a></noscript> | view more ... interdisciplinary elements of subject area the collection aims to support the interdisciplinary aspects of music, particularly in the areas of religion and music, the arts and music, and literature and music. the music collection is enhanced by our holdings in religion, literature, art, education, philosophy, management and psychology. formats and types of materials the collection consists of music scores (full scores, study scores, piano-vocal scores, facsimiles and some performance editions with instrumental parts), monographs, periodicals (in print and online), reference works, electronic databases some with full text, and microforms. the library has compact discs, dvds, videotapes, long playing albums, cd-roms, and subscriptions to databases with streamed music. when possible and practical, materials are purchased in electronic formats. languages most music monographs and periodicals are in english. selected works in other languages are purchased when recommended by a faculty member of the music department. geographic area coverage the music collection (in all formats, i.e., print and non-print material) focuses primarily on western and to some degree on non-western music and cultures. research and creative works dealing with these subject areas are collected, thus imposing no geographic area restrictions. time periods music recordings, scores, monographs, periodicals and other materials covering all time periods are purchased. dates of publication current monographs, newest editions of music scores, and the latest technologies for media materials are collected. important works (monument and historical sets) by major composers are collected retrospectively as are historical sound recordings in the latest format available. updated: march 22, 2011 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of page \u00a9 2014 the trustees of boston college. legal", "hrefTitle": "Music",

date specified in the e-mail, borrowing privileges may be suspended and a fine incurred. requests for on-shelf materials a request placed for an item listed as available on shelf can only be delivered

o'neill library. if another pickup location is chosen additional time is needed for delivery from o'neill library to that location. on order/in process requests in the unlikely event that you do not receive the book/journal article that you requested, or are not updated in a timely manner, send an email message to notices@bc.edu and a staff member will look into your request. cannot find a book? request a search. circulation staff will search for books that you cannot find and are not charged out. to use this service go to any circulation desk to report the book missing. if the book is found

libraries > libraries & collections > by subject > english and american literature collection brendan a. rapple bibliographer 617-552-4482 rappleb@bc.edu collection overview the primary purpose of the english and american literature budget is to support the teaching and research of literature. the diverse clientele served include english department faculty and students, other boston college faculty, students, staff, others from the bc community, visiting scholars and students, and other members of the general public. it is a major goal of the collections to serve the courses taught by the english department and the research needs of the faculty and students. the predominant emphasis of the collection is on the literature in english of the u.s. and england. however, there is substantial collecting in literature in the english language of other nations. to support the study of literature, primary focus is on acquiring appropriate editions of the actual literary works of major and selected minor authors. collecting stress is also placed on critical studies and on materials pertaining to such areas as contemporary and past literary theories, on cultural studies and literature, on religion and literature, on race and literature, on music and literature, on psychoanalysis and literature, on feminism and literature, on gender theory and literature, on bibliography, on comparative literature, on the history of the english language, on creative writing, on the cinema and literature, on folktales, on methods of research, on the history of ideas and literature, on the pedagogy of literature, on rhetoric, on composition theory and the teaching of writing, etc. the nature of the subject determines that most materials will be monographs. most of the latter are in print format. however, the library has made a strong commitment to purchase as many full-text databases as possible. in recent years the library has acquired eighteenth century collections online , a database containing the full-text of every significant english-language and foreign-language title printed in great britain between 1701 and 1800, along with thousands of important works from the americas. this important database complements well two other bc libraries' databases: early english books online (eebo) , which provides full-text access to nearly every english language book published from the invention of printing to 1700, and evans digital edition , the full-text digital collection of books, pamphlets, and broadsides printed in america from 1639-1800. these databases are composed of hundreds of thousands of monographs in digital format. it is highly probable that the library will continue to purchase such databases which will result in the acquisition of more older monographs in digital format. clearly a large number of journal subscriptions is also essential. several years ago o'neill library greatly increased its subscriptions to english journals. though it is anticipated that the number of journals added in the near future will not be as great, new journal subscriptions will continue to be made as appropriate. journals collected are primarily those of literary criticism and major literary reviews. some journals of creative writing are collected, though it is not the policy to acquire a comprehensive collection of literary magazines. the increasing focus on collecting in electronic format is dealt with in formats and types of materials below. | view selected resources \u00bb recent additions to the collection <noscript><a

subject area the english department has connections with a number of other disciplines including american studies, black studies, theatre, irish studies, women's studies, medieval studies, education, linguistics, and others. much of the material purchased from the english budget support the literary elements in these disciplines. as there is sometimes an overlap between the needs of the english department programs and the needs of the programs of other schools and departments, it is important that there is no duplication of major purchases. a significant interdisciplinary element of the collection development of english concerns the selective purchase of translations into english of major literary works of other languages. primary texts, as well as critical treatments, of classic works in children's literature are collected to support research and courses offered by the english department and the school of education. however, the great majority of the primary and critical works of contemporary children's literature are purchased by and housed in the educational resource center . (view the erc's collection statement ). formats and types of materials most of the monographs, serials, and reference works of the american and english literature collection continue to be in print on paper format. collecting decisions regarding edition, imprint, and whether hardback or paperback depend on intellectual appropriateness, availability, durability and affordability. libraries are naturally inextricably linked with the world of publishing. while much of the latter is still vitally concerned with the traditional world of print, its electronic nature is growing at a tremendous rate. publishing's utilization of technology\u2019s continually evolving capabilities is contributing to an inexorable change in research, especially due to the thriving improvements in data manipulation, not just of text but of images, sound, and videos. complementing innovative production types of electronic research activity are new models of digital scholarly publishing that are ensuring that the dissemination of research findings electronically will increasingly be the norm. accordingly, as o'neill becomes increasingly a digital library, particular focus is being placed on collecting and providing access to electronic materials. appropriate full-text electronic databases of primary and secondary works relating to american and english literature as well as literature related electronic periodicals continue to be acquired. relevant electronic bibliographic citation databases are also obtained. the library is also purchasing a growing number of important multidisciplinary full-text databases that are valuable for much literary research.dissertations and theses completed at other institutions are selectively purchased depending on the particular research needs of english department faculty and graduate students. however, the library also provides the ability to download the full text of most dissertations completed at boston college and elsewhere since 1997 through the database proquest dissertations and theses - full text . languages most of the material collected is in the english language. however, important critical works on english and american literature and language in german, french, italian, spanish and other european languages are also added to the collection. preference is given to english translations, when available, of these foreign language works. important works on literary critical theory as well as interdisciplinary aspects of english and american literature in major foreign languages are also acquired. translations into english of major literary works of other languages are selectively purchased to support research, curricular, and general interest needs. geographic area coverage the literature of the united states and england constitutes the primary focus of the collection. (a major focus is also on the literature of ireland. this area is covered in the irish studies collection statement ). literature in english of scotland, wales, and canada are next in importance. other areas of the english speaking world (australia, new zealand, india, south africa, etc.) are represented by their major authors. there is also increasing emphasis on collecting the major authors and major critical works of the caribbean area. representative important authors of anglophone black africa are also collected. time periods all time periods of english and american literature are collected. there are no limitations. dates of publication materials published in the united states since 1860 and published elsewhere since 1800 are eligible for collection. earlier materials are judged for appropriateness for burns library. when collecting retrospective materials or replacing missing or deteriorated materials, formats with a long expected life, such as reprints on acid-free paper or microforms, are sought. increasingly, appropriate retrospective materials are in electronic format. updated: december 22, 2011 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top of

department's sponsorship of the interdisciplinary m.a. in european national studies, which concentrates on the history and language of a single european nation, and an m.a. in medieval studies.

sociology, political science, business, theology and science (see collection statements of these areas). works of history are collected for the above areas and other areas where there may not be an emphasis in the respective program on history, for example as in business history. a large number of materials of historical interest are collected in the library of congress \"h\" section, which includes sociology, business and economics. formats and types of materials formats collected include print, electronic, microform, and audiovisual. types of materials include monographs, serials, and

english, with materials collected also in french, gaelic, german, italian, russian and spanish, with other languages selectively collected. geographic area coverage the major emphases are on europe and the united states, with emphasis also on latin america, and there is broad collection development for africa, asia and the middle east along with specific targeting of program needs for those areas. selected works are collected for other areas. time periods history by its nature lends itself to an interest in all time periods. there is more emphasis from the medieval period to the present than on ancient history. dates of publication although the bulk of collecting is current imprints, much emphasis in library purchasing for the history department is placed on retrospective acquisitions, so that publishing dates range from the present as far back as they can go, but with items considered rare or in need of special handling being housed in the burns special collections

journals published in german-speaking countries as well as the u.s. are collected. research and study in german studies relies heavily on materials from other subject collections e.g., history, music,

acquired by direct purchase in greece, thanks to periodic visits by a member of the department. research and study in classical studies relies heavily on materials from other subject collections relevant to classical studies, e.g., philosophy and history. rapid advances in computer and networking technology have resulted in the acquisition of significant electronic resources, including electronic versions of familiar classical studies indexes and digitized full-text editions of primary sources. classical studies has been a pioneer in the field of digitized texts and bc has the thesaurus linguae graecae, one of the earliest collections of electronic texts produced by modern scholarship. the classical studies collection program has emphasized acquisition of digitized

the theatre department\u2019s production: rising up: a dance showcase , and celebrating the 30 th anniversary of the robsham theater arts center, came the idea of photographing boston college student dancers in locations all around campus. inspired by the ballerina project in new york city, the marketing campaign promotes the idea of dance as part of the fabric of our lives. the photography by marc franklin \u201912 and nate richardson \u201913 captures ordinary people in conventional places. yet, these flashes of brilliance gently mix the beauty of art with the common flow of everyday life at boston college. what makes the project special is how personal it is. the places are familiar and the people even more familiar. the rising up project represents a larger culture at bc comprised of artists of all kinds. it makes evident that art is everywhere, and how a simple promotion idea can evolve and flourish into a creative and advanced photographic exploration! about the gallery level

o\u2019neill library, main reading room, level 3 february 26, 4:00pm reception to follow \u201canya kamenetz offers a thoughtful and much-needed call to rethink higher education in a world of spiraling tuition costs, a 50 percent college drop-out rate, and a growing understanding that the one-size-fits-all college model is broken.\u201d \u2013 daniel h. pink, author of drive and a whole new mind anya kamenetz is bringing an entirely unexpected perspective on the future of knowledge, talent, and innovation. an educational futurist and the rare speaker on issues facing the millennials, who actually belongs to this generation, she delivers audiences core insights into change, technology, and talent. on campuses, kamenetz can help your students manage money better, choose career paths they are passionate about, and step up to become america\u2019s next generation of leaders. her feature series on village voice became a highly regarded book entitled generation debt: the new economics of being young . written when she was just 24, generation debt (riverhead books, 2006), drew national media attention and passionate online debate with its argument that young people are facing unique and unprecedented economic challenges. her latest book, diy u: edupunks, edupreneurs, and the coming transformation of higher education, (chelsea green, 2010) tells the story of how technology is disrupting one of the most tradition-bound industries in the country--no industry is safe. it\u2019s an important book about talent, human capital, and how our institutions must evolve to meet the challenges of the next century. her book, learning, freedom, and the web, in collaboration with the mozilla community, will be out in early september. the edupunk's guide to a diy credential , which is funded by the gates foundation, is available for free download now. she is a sought-after media expert regularly appearing on major news networks including cbs, abc, cnn, msnbc, fox news, cnbc, and npr. currently, she covers the future of business, including sustainability and social entrepreneurship, as a senior writer for fast company magazine, and is a nationally syndicated columnist for tribune media. kamenetz\u2019s energetic, informative and down-to-earth presentations draw on her own experience and years of research. she has insight into a range of generation-specific issues most relevant to people in their 20s and 30s: technology and social networking; flex time and work-life balance; finding career passion through engagement in the new green economy and social entrepreneurship; the rising cost of higher education and health care; and money management. updated: february 26, 2013 maintained by: university libraries contact | feedback | top

libraries newsletter - fall 2013 volume 14 number 4 fall 2013 the illustrated london news online archive bc libraries recently purchased the illustrated london news online archive , a full-text database of every issue of the illustrated london news (iln), the world's first fully illustrated weekly newspaper. the first issue of the iln appeared on 14th may, 1842. it might be said that before the iln people didn't really know what the rest of the world looked like. newspapers and other journals had certainly existed for many years (it's interesting to consult the database eighteenth century journals ). however, with few exceptions these were solely text with only the very occasional woodcut. people were used to reading speeches by the well-known politicians of the day but without any idea what these individuals looked like. but now with the publication of the iln the public could not only read the words of politicians and other famous individuals but actually see images of the personalities themselves. thus, such representations brought reality to people, as well as to places and events, that up to then readers could only imagine. another prominent first for the iln occurred on 22 december, 1855 when in its christmas supplement it published the first color images ever printed in a british newspaper. the circulation of the iln in its first year of publication was 60,000. this rose to a peak of 300,000 in the 1860s when it was by far the most popular newspaper among the british middle classes. it was published weekly until 1971, monthly until 1989, bimonthly until 1994 and then twice a year until it ceased publication in 2003. the iln database, a resource that covers the whole of victorian society as well as the complete twentieth century includes every issue from the first in 1842 together with all special numbers and reports. it comprises about 260,000 pages, over 7,000 issues, and more than 1.5 million images. the text of every article and caption is full-text searchable. one may view, print and save articles as a separate page or as part of the original published layout next to the other articles, illustrations and advertisements. searching is quite sophisticated and accommodates boolean and proximity search operators and wildcards. in advanced search mode one may also search specifically by contributor, article title and caption, date, illustrations, features, news etc. newcastle and gateshead great fire 1854 handcoloured woodblock engraving from the illustrated london news, 14th october 1854 the iln is a wonderful compendium of social, cultural and political history with excellent coverage of arts, science, literature, theatre, media, sport, disasters, fashion, royalty, exploration, transport, ceremonies, war, advertising and more. crime reporting was always a particularly popular feature. important victorian events that the paper covered to great interest from the public included the great exhibition of 1851, the french revolution of 1848, the laying of the transatlantic cable, the funeral of the duke of wellington in 1855. the iln even published plans for the crystal palace before prince albert himself had seen them. war was particularly well covered and included the crimean war, the american civil war, the boer war, world wars one and two, the vietnam conflicts. the iln allows one to read first hand accounts of major developments in the history of transport from the invention and evolution of the automobile to the historic flight by the wright brothers in 1903 to space travel in the twentieth century. the history of fashion with its myriad of changes is well represented and especially so in the numerous advertisements for evening wear, sportswear, undergarments, mourning garb, jewelry, cosmetics etc. one can research the history of sports in great britain, from the common to the more unusual ones of pig-sticking and cock-fighting. particularly fascinating is the history of discovery and exploration with detailed accounts of the exploits of livingstone, stanley, burton, franklin, shackleton, scott and others. one can research the course of politics and political figures, the progress of medicine, science, technology, the growth and evolution of industry and trade, the development of the arts and the humanities. the great sea-serpent, from an 1850s issue of the illustrated london news the iln is also a wonderful treasury of fiction and poetry by many well-known authors. prominent names include j.m. barrie, agatha christie, wilkie collins, joseph conrad, arthur conan doyle, h. rider haggard, thomas hardy, rudyard kipling, w. somerset maugham, robert louis stevenson, anthony trollope and h.g. wells. g.k. chesterton wrote for the \"our note book\" column for over thirty years. the work of american writers also appeared in the iln and includes that of henry james, stephen crane, bret harte, nathaniel hawthorne, and william dean howells. the first issue in 1842, costing sixpence, had sixteen pages and 32 wood-engravings. it sold 26,000 copies. among the numerous articles were reports on the great fire in the city of hamburg, on military engagements in kabul (titled cabul) during the first anglo-afghan war, on queen victoria's fancy dress ball at buckingham palace.there were theatre and book reviews; a report from the royal academy exhibition on sculptures; a column on horticulture; announcements of births, deaths and marriages; an article on the origin of the mail-coach system. an article entitled \"antidote for the slave-trade\" reported that \"the slave-trade is now indelibly branded by civilized europe as infamous in those nations that allow it, iniquitous towards man, and wicked defiance of the almighty.\" in a letter to the editor from paris under the heading \"fashion\" we are told that \"white is but little worn at present by our \u00e9l\u00e9gantes for the promenade, but it enjoys their patronage in our salons.\" there was also a report of a court case that involved a fracas between two irish women drinking tea together \"with all the evidences upon them of having been recently engaged in pugilistic contest. the complainant in particular had her face so tattooed by the nails of her adversary, that she resembled a new zealand squaw.\" thus, one might observe that this first issue of the iln already displays some of the stereotypes of the irish and of colonial races that were common in victorian media. skibbereen 1847 by cork artist james mahony (1810-1879), commissioned by illustrated london news , 1847. illustrating the great famine. the illustrated london news brought an exciting, informative and entertaining new vision to the victorian middle class. by the twentieth century it had become an institution, though as the years went by it naturally had numerous competitors and, of course, lost its innovative cachet. still, it lasted until the following century its last issue appearing in

newsletter - spring 2013 volume 14 number 2 spring 2013 the core and burns library: a pedagogical adventure \"as we ask ourselves what we can really tell about a book by its cover, we are really asking how the book, as an artifact of its time and cultural context, can lend us insight into the period itself.\" so one student in my core course (hs035, \"europe and the modern world i\") trenchantly observed as she began her response paper detailing a visit to the burns library last semester. this visit constituted one of several adventures in experiential learning, including self-guided trips to the mfa, film viewings and attending on-campus academic presentations, that i asked students to undertake in conjunction with the more traditional course components of lectures, readings and discussion sections. this young scholar, like the majority of the other students in this course, approached work outside the classroom with enthusiasm. given that many boston college undergraduates inhabit a primarily if not exclusively digital world \u0097 indeed, some seldom interact with books printed in the last year, let alone incunabula \u0097 the positive responses to the journey through rare books in particular may seem surprising. i attribute this outcome to the burns library's exceedingly generous and knowledgeable staff, who did not quail at my request to send 200 students trooping through the repository last semester and who also worked extra hours to ensure that their visitors would be able to think productively (and in many cases for the first time) about the printed book as material evidence of attitudes toward knowledge production and circulation. bridget burke, associate university librarian for special collections, and kathleen williams, irish studies specialist, deserve particular praise for their cheerful willingness to try this pedagogical experiment and for the clever way in which they arranged the special exhibition for this class (of which more anon). i have a sneaking suspicion that their efforts may in time prove to have been the genesis of some future archivists, librarians and historians of the book \u0097 or at least a good number of honors projects that involve research time at burns. in any case, they have my eternal gratitude for making a professor's crazy summer brainstorm a reality and a success. and so i emailed bridget burke, who responded immediately and with great excitement about the prospect of getting hundreds of young people into burns who might not otherwise have had occasion to go there. she did, however, quite reasonably defend the priceless tomes from excessive mauling and the reading room from excessive disruption by rethinking the structure of the exercise. after a happy meeting with her and kathleen williams, we settled on a more practical but no less exciting alternative: bridget, kathleen and their colleagues would set up a special display case for my course, in which there would be a rotating roster of texts for students to view and analyze that were relevant to the century and essential developments we were studying at any given time. the burns dream team did an outstanding job of choosing books that meshed perfectly, moment to moment, with the narrative arc of the syllabus. while the galileo volume had perhaps the most crowd appeal, i was struck each time the response papers came in at their thoughtful and detailed analysis \u0097 clear evidence that the exercise worked with our course content. students really got the idea that, even centuries after the printing press, the book was often still a luxury good either priced beyond the means of or linguistically unavailable to many people. as one student remarked, \"books were hard to come by, even with the advent of the printing press, so people took pride in their books and book makers took time to create a piece worth owning.\" in addition to \"our\" display, i also asked students to view the recent exhibition, \"fine specimens of the bibliopegistic art: bookbindings from the burns library collections,\" which helped them to think about materials and logistics of book production. beyond the essential point of the exercise, however, students also took up the challenge of finding out more about one text they viewed (its authorship, importance at the time, likely readership and ownership history) \u0097 a task that the helpful glossary of terms and other finding aids that kathleen williams provided made feasible. one of my fears about the adventure, i must admit, was that students might feel bewildered once they got to the library. i could not physically be present for 230 individual bibliographic journeys! fortunately, both bridget and kathleen took time early in the semester to come to lecture, introduce themselves and welcome students' questions. i have had reports from both of them that students regularly took them up on the kind offer, seeking out help and further information from them personally or from other staff members. thus, luckily, my fear proved groundless. i was especially delighted to see that several students incorporated material gleaned from their visit to the burns in their final exam essays. so, too, a number of students' narrative course evaluations stressed that this course (to quote one respondent) \"made history interesting,\" and cited the burns visit as one of the reasons for this happy event. another student noted that the burns excursion was particularly valuable because it gave them access to historical material \"that we had available right on campus.\" yes, burns library is one of bc's great treasures! naturally, i plan to incorporate visits to burns in subsequent iterations of the course \u0097 indeed, as long as the patience of the staff holds out, as it promises to do. taking into consideration some students who had some difficulty (despite all our best efforts) in connecting their \"field trip\" to other aspects of the course, i plan to emphasize the history of the book, as such, even more than i have done to date. to judge by the strikingly positive responses of last semester's students, these iphone wielding denizens of facebook found the early-modern \"information explosion\" riveting. more importantly, those students came to appreciate the enduring but still fragile literary artifacts of the past, and the painfully long story of the democratization of knowledge that they help to tell. i find it most heartening that core students' experience at burns, instead of being a mere academic task, actually provoked some to think about their instantaneous access to knowledge \u0097 a membership in the republic of letters that they sometimes take for granted. i can't wait for the next adventure. in the meantime, i have been singing the praises of the burns experience to colleagues, and i believe that several are planning to make this repository a central part of their core courses as well. i do worry that the library staff may in time wonder what possessed them to turn their building into a pedagogical grand central station ... actually, on second thought, there's no cause for worry. they will no doubt remain as generous as ever and find ways to make everything work, as usual. sarah gwyneth ross associate professor, history department questions, comments? contact the bc libraries

library system implementation, which we began in the summer of 2012, has been buggy, and i'm aware that it has caused frustration. some folks have wondered why we chose to go forward with the new system, so let me explain the rationale. holmes , the library catalog, represents the interface most library users see. however, the actual library implementation involved the back end system that most folks do not see. that back end, which supports library operations, is named alma. the bc libraries are the first worldwide instance of the alma system, and while we usually opt for \"near cutting edge,\" in this case we decided on the bleeding edge. as a brand new system built using 21st century technologies, alma provides a solid technical infrastructure and a host of new services that will enable us not only to better manage our resources, but to integrate seamlessly with other campus systems and to build research tools which better serve faculty, students and researchers. additionally, the holmes system under alma provides the capability for customized searching and personalized discovery services. by moving in this direction, we hope to make the experience more google-like, with filtering that increases integration and permits seamless customization as determined by the user. within the year, we plan to begin offering personalized discovery services which filter and integrate digital and web-based library content as determined by the user's academic profile and personal preferences. finally, although holmes has been available for several years, our data shows that most users tended to access our content via quest, which limited results to bc-owned materials only. with holmes, the results bring in much more rich content. people can still limit results to bc owned items, or they can choose to view the wide scope of resources. i'd like to think that with the expanded capabilities of the new holmes, more folks would discover and utilize the hundreds of other sources found on our web site. frequently, holmes will identify results from such specialized sources, and the \"power-users\" will then go to the more subject-focused databases to dig deeper and have more search options specific to the subject matter. ideally, more library users will become more comfortable with all the relevant value-added resources within our digital offerings, and the holmes system should make becoming a power-user easier and even commonplace. for more on these types of searches, please consult with your subject librarian or ask (text, email, call or stop by) any of our services desks. so while the alma/holmes implementation continues, i hope this explanation helps in understanding why we have undertaken this effort and that you continue to help us in identifying ways we can improve the system. as always, thanks for your patience and feedback. tom wall university librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter

back on fall 2012 graduate student focus group results as reported in this past fall's faculty newsletter , the libraries have continued their efforts to learn from you what you need and want in terms of e-books. this past october, following up on the spring 2012 e-book survey and an august 2012 faculty focus group, both conducted with the help of institutional research, planning & assessment (irpa), a small group of graduate students came together to talk with us about their interests/needs for e-books. here is a quick summary of some of their thoughts: just as with faculty, graduate students believe that the ability to annotate pdfs and other e-book formats is critical. they tend to continue to use print books for any extended or intellectually-rigorous reading. they definitely see a place for e-books, and are using them ... notably, the focus group members predominantly use e-book readers or other mobile devices for this purpose. given the long commutes some graduate students endure, there is definite interest in audio e-books, and not just for pleasure reading. this is not something that we heard from faculty in their focus group. as a result of information gained at both focus groups, we've increased the visibility of the boston college libraries' e-book collections with a new link on the library homepage\u0097look for the logo, top left, on the library homepage. it takes you into the e-books research guide which can provide useful information on finding and using e-books (including annotating options for e-books). you'll also see more displays

college libraries newsletter - spring 2013 volume 14 number 2 spring 2013 get your copyright back: your window of opportunity if you signed an agreement transferring copyright to a publisher anytime between 1978 and 1988, you have a window of opportunity to terminate that transfer, right now. many scholars find themselves in this position: they wrote a book in the late seventies to late eighties. they transferred their copyright to the publisher who agreed to publish and distribute the work. after a period of time the work fell into out-of-print limbo, seldom available and not commercially exploited. a provision of copyright law has just come into effect that can provide some relief for those willing to take affirmative steps. one benefit of regaining control of your work is the ability to take advantage of new publishing models such as digital, open access publication. the university libraries can help by sending your publication to the internet archive, where it can be digitized and made available in pdf, kindle and epub versions, at no cost to you. boston college's internet archive collections have also contributed to the massive hathitrust digital library. anyone with an internet connection can access the work, anywhere in the world, giving the greatest possible visibility to your work. 17 usc \u00a7 203 allows authors to terminate transfers of copyright to their works. because of the timing constraints written into the law, the first of those works will revert to the author on january 1, 2013, if the author navigated all the regulations successfully. in summary, here's how it works: the provision only applies to copyright transfer agreements signed after january 1, 1978. authors can terminate the transfer and regain copyright to their works no sooner than 35 years after the agreement was signed, and no later than 40 years after the agreement was signed; a five-year window. in order to terminate the agreement the author must give notice to the copyright holder no later than two years before the termination date and no more than 10 years before the date. so, for copyrights transferred any time between 1978 and 1988, the window of opportunity to regain those rights is right now. here's my reading of the operative dates for two termination time frames. agreements in the intervening years could also be terminated, with comparable deadlines applied. jan 1, 1978 agreement: earliest possible termination jan 1, 2013 last possible termination jan 1, 2018 earliest possible notice jan 1, 2003 last possible notice jan 1, 2016 jan 1, 1988 agreement: earliest possible termination jan 1, 2023 last possible termination jan 1, 2028 earliest possible notice jan 1, 2013 last possible notice jan 1, 2026 regulations from the copyright office specify exactly what should be contained in the notice, including: a statement that the termination is made under section 203 the name of each grantee whose rights are being terminated the date of execution of the grant being terminated for each work to which the notice of termination applies, the title of the work and the name of the author or authors who executed the grant being terminated the effective date of termination a brief statement reasonably identifying the grant to which the notice of termination applies the notice must be signed by all authors terminating the transfer of rights. it can be mailed by first class mail and should also be recorded with the copyright office (a fee is charged). the rules to effect this termination of a transfer of copyright are fairly exacting. anyone who contemplates doing it should review the statute , the regulations and copyright office circular 12 . if you have questions about this opportunity, please contact jane morris ,

14 number 2 spring 2013 emerging pathways in digital humanities teaching there is an oft-told story, possibly an urban legend, about a university that took an unorthodox approach to designing new sidewalks during a campus landscaping project. instead of building sidewalks and then watching students cut across the grass between them, they simply planted grass and then waited to see where people walked. once the paths were well-worn, they paved them. architects call these \"desire lines\" because they represent the routes people take in the absence of (or avoidance of) pre-existing paths. as in many universities around the country, many of us at boston college have been exploring paths in digital humanities teaching for several years but without a deliberate or coordinated plan in our approach. we've simply started doing projects that took advantage of new tools and the opportunities they presented. fortunately, some common paths have emerged over time and now we can see some patterns that are worth highlighting. emerging practices here are some successful practices that have emerged in the context of undergraduate teaching: enable real research and wider audiences invite students to conduct primary research and participate in projects that provide wider audiences for their research: fine arts professors sheila gallagher and judy bookbinder involved their students in researching unidentified civil war sketches in the becker collection and their findings appeared in a mcmullen museum exhibit and on the exhibit website . english professor paul lewis's students found a public audience for their research when their work on under-appreciated boston writers was included in the \"forgotten chapters of boston's literary history\" exhibit and on the accompanying website. history professor jeremy clarke's students contributed content for a burns library exhibit and website meant to make rare books about china available to the public. turn courses into opportunities when possible, design courses that take advantage of a larger project or event: paul lewis, sheila gallagher and judy bookbinder intentionally designed courses to take advantage of upcoming exhibits and get their students involved in contributing content for them. joe nugent in the english department created a course on joyce's dubliners with the goal of having students produce an ebook guide called \"digital dubliners\" as part of the ibook author pilot. encourage retooling expose students to existing digital humanities methods and provide opportunities to experiment with both existing tools and emerging technologies: with support from library staff, laurie shepard taught her italian literature students tei (text encoding initiative) as a way to engage more deeply with sixteenth century comedies. joe nugent had students help plan the walking ulysses project by plotting the route of the characters around dublin on a google map, and had students learn, together with joe himself, how to create a multimedia ibook on dubliners . embrace collaboration digital humanities are defined at least as much as a new set of relationships as they are by a new set of technologies. when faculty designed opportunities to collaborate with students, and not just teach them, the result was a richer experience for both. none of these projects could have happened without the close collaboration of faculty members, library staff, and ides, often with the support of university grants and information technology services. new standards de christiana expeditione apud sinas , 1615. as these best practices gain recognition, they begin to shape new tools and resources, and worn footpaths receive the support of intentional paving. library ventures such as participation in tei are complemented by developments in technologies for teaching. this past year has seen the launch of a new version of mediakron , an instructional multi-media presentation platform created at bc with support from ides, and funding from an academic technology innovation grant and the davis educational foundation. new features, many of which were added in response to faculty requests, reflect these trends of greater connection with other colleagues, experimental technologies and the wider world of scholarship and programs. different access levels let instructors invite students to comment or even contribute content, so their research can be central to the site. items in mediakron can be plotted on a map, now including google maps. reference librarians have played a key role in providing content for many of the sites currently in pilot. many instructors voice the hope that original research and data collection represented in their sites might eventually be made available for teaching and study in other institutions. projects that in the past may have required an academic technology innovation grant (atig) now often can be done using mediakron instead, offering a more sustainable way of supporting digital humanities going forward. in going forward, new paths will still emerge even as digital humanities tools and collaborations become more established around the university. the digital humanities are exciting both for how much is happening and how much there is yet to be explored as tools and methods continue to evolve. please do not hesitate to contact ides at eteach@bc.edu if we can help in any way with your instructional digital projects. tim lindgren instructional designer, instructional design and eteaching services sarah castricum instructional

number 2 spring 2013 two university presses in the digital age if you had to guess which english language university presses published the greatest number of books a year, you might think of oxford and cambridge and you would be right. but you might not guess how much more productive they are compared to other university presses. according to global books in print , oxford university press published 1,649 hardcover titles for the u.s. market and cambridge 1,252. the highest american university press total was 224 titles from the university of chicago press. clearly the two british university presses are the giants of the academic publishing world. the origins of both presses go back to the 16th century. cambridge claims to have the oldest publishing house in the world which was started by a grant from henry viii in 1534. however, the university did not produce a book until it appointed thomas thomas in 1583 to be the first university printer. the boston college libraries' resource early english books online provides us with digitized versions of thomas's earliest volumes, for example doctrinae christianae compendium by zacharias ursinus published in 1585. oxford received the right to print in 1586 and selected a local bookseller, joseph barnes, to be its first printer. among the earliest items produced by his press was the first book in greek to be printed at oxford, six homilies of st. chrysostom in greek , 1586. during the following centuries, both publishers grew into their current status as the major university presses of our time. given their prominence in publishing history and considerable print title output, can we assume that both presses are also major players in the new world of e-publishing? i think we can, but let's take a look at what they have published on the web to see if our assumption has any validity. both cup and oup are prolific e-journal publishers, but in this article i will focus on the e-book side of their operations. both are publishers of major reference works. cambridge has made two of its major reference resources available on the web, its single and multivolume sets of cambridge histories and the cambridge companion series. both resources have been highly regarded for many years, and to have them in a more easily accessible and searchable format has been an immense boon to scholars and students. cambridge histories online covers a wide range of time periods and subject areas including ancient history (19 volumes in the print format); modern history (13); histories of philosophy (15); histories of india (22), china (13), and latin america (12); and history of christianity (9). subjects covered in smaller sets or single volumes include language and linguistics, literature, music, political and social theory, and theatre and performing arts among others. i recommend spending time browsing the full list of histories to get a better sense of what is available. and as with many online resources, cambridge histories online has features which can facilitate research like a reserved virtual space for saved searches, bookmarks, and notes. the cambridge companions series is available on the web as cambridge collections online (cco). this database is comprised of three collections of companions: literature and classics (265 titles); philosophy, religion, and culture (171); and music (59). cco can be searched as a whole or by individual volume. a scan of titles in cco will give a good idea of its remarkable breadth and depth of coverage. for example, someone needing material on plato will find ample information in the companions to plato , plato's republic , greek and roman philosophy , and ancient greek political thought among many others. if you were beginning a research project focusing on goethe, the companions to goethe , european novelists , and german romanticism might be helpful. each companion volume is composed of a number of substantial essays on what the editors consider the most important topics relevant to the companion's subject, and each essay is downloadable as a pdf. oxford university press's first major entry into the digital age was the electronic version of the premier dictionary of the english language, the oxford english dictionary , appearing initially as a cd-rom (1988) and then as an online resource, oxford english dictionary online (2000) . the online database contains the entire second edition of the oed and is updated quarterly with revisions that will be included in the third edition. logophiles can check the oed online site for the oed's most recently published words (on the home page), provide an earlier record of a word which oed editors are currently researching (see the oed appeals page ), and even follow oed-related chatter on oed's twitter feed . two other significant reference resources are the newly reconfigured oxford reference online (oro) and oxford bibliographies online (obo). the former is a composite of over 300 titles which offer brief entries or essays useful for quick reference checks. it also has over 200 timelines ; finding one for a particular subject or historical time period can be a bit of a challenge, but oro provides a list of subject categories in a narrow your choices box on the left side of the timelines page . oxford bibliographies online can be considered oxford's answer to the seeming chaos of information on the web. each obo module is a subject bibliography with an editor who is a recognized expert in the field. obo accurately describes itself as a combination of \"the best features of an annotated bibliography and a high-level encyclopedia.\" the boston college libraries have thus far acquired the obo modules in atlantic history , biblical studies (bc's christopher matthews is editor-in-chief), education , hinduism , islamic studies , latin american studies , and medieval studies . the bibliographic articles are authored by experts on the article topic and are composed of short introductions followed by extensive annotated bibliographies listing critical editions and significant scholarship on the topic. a brief scan of the first article, alfred the great, and its bibliography in the medieval studies bibliography will give a good idea of how valuable this resource can be. taking advantage of the web's dynamic capacity for instant updates, oup has designed obo to be frequently updated with the most current citations and to keep adding 50-75 articles per subject each year. thirty-two subject bibliographies have been published thus far, and more are on the way. feel free to contact your subject librarian if you would like to recommend that the library acquire one or more of them. zacharias ursinus. doctrinae christianae compendium, 1585. a third type of reference resource from oxford are websites offering access to a collection of online materials including primary sources, biographies, images, maps, timelines, and sometimes multimedia. of this type, the boston college libraries have acquired the oxford african american studies center , oxford biblical studies online , and oxford islamic studies online (of which bc's natana j. delong-bas is deputy editor). with its inclusion of six different bible texts and commentaries, the biblical studies resource continues oup's history as a major publisher of english language bibles going back to the seventeenth century when the university received the right to print the king james authorized version of the bible. oup has produced many other excellent and authoritative reference works and brought them to the web; they can be found by going to the library's research databases site , clicking on the by title tab, and typing oxford in the search box. both cup and oup have also created online platforms for their extensive collections of monographs and edited works. cambridge books online has made more than 13,000 books available on the web and plans to add thousands more from the cup backlist. an example of a title owned by the library is jesus as teacher by pheme perkins of bc's theology department. users can download chapters as pdfs and use acrobat reader to highlight text and take notes. oxford scholarship online (oso) offers oup titles in subject collections, and the library has acquired the religion and social work collections. if you were to access language in the confessions of augustine by philip burton, you could download chapters as pdfs as well as save them online in your personal work space in oso. the subject collections can be searched as a single unit or by individual title. because oup provides abstracts for both books and chapters, searching oso's contents will seem similar to searching a journal database like jstor, only the units of content are book chapters instead of journal articles. jonas barciauskas head of collection development, o'neill library questions, comments? contact the

library burns library has an important collection of the papers of coventry patmore (23 july, 1823 - 26 november, 1896). patmore, a prominent literary figure, was for a short period one of the most widely read poets in england, though as the nineteenth century progressed his poetry was less and less appreciated. raised in a literary home, his father a well-known man of letters, patmore from early on was interested in art. his copy of one of landseer's pictures was awarded the silver palette of the royal society of arts in 1838. he was only fourteen. he also developed a strong interest in science as a youth, his father even building him his own laboratory. strongly influenced by tennyson's 1842 collected poems, patmore in 1844 published his first book of poetry, poems . though well received by some, including leigh hunt, robert browning, and bulwer lytton, it was savagely reviewed by blackwood's magazine : \"this is the life into which the slime of the keateses and shelleys of former times has fecundated.\" it is clear that patmore himself later considered that these early poems were somewhat weak as he did not include any in his four volume collected poems published in 1879. undated framed photograph of coventry patmore in 1846 monckton milnes helped patmore secure a post as a supernumerary assistant in the department of the printed books in the british museum, a post he held until 1865. the angel in the house was patmore's first major poetical work. this was composed of four volumes: the betrothal (1854), the espousals (1856), faithful for ever (1860), and the victories of love (1863). this poetry, a paean to his first wife emily augusta andrews, had as its primary subject the pleasures of an ideal marriage. though received very well by the victorians as the ideal of married love-over a quarter million copies had been sold by patmore's death-it has been often criticized, for example by virginia woolf, as being sexist and contributing to the subordination of women. however, john maynard observes that this subsequent vilification of patmore is somewhat unfair, as his views were quite common in his day. still, though angel in the house has distinct poetic virtuosity, its frequent mawkishness renders its appeal to be limited for today's readers. soon after emily died in 1862 leaving patmore with six young children, he traveled to rome where he converted to catholicism. in 1864 he remarried. his new wife, marianne caroline byles, another catholic convert, brought financial security to patmore that allowed him to retire from his british museum position and devote the remainder of his life to literary pursuits. in 1877 patmore published the elegiac the unknown eros, and other odes whose themes center on the nature of both human love and the higher love of god. in the same year he visited lourdes and made a number of retreats. in 1878 he published another series of narrative love poems, amelia , reputably his favorite set of poems. at about this time patmore became deep friends with the poet alice meynell who was a fervent champion of his poetry. however, after patmore began to wish that the friendship become more than platonic, meynell withdrew. (burns library has an important collection of meynell's papers including a scrapbook of articles, reviews, and poems, poetry and prose manuscripts, and correspondence. burns also has a selection of derek patmore's papers which contain the very interesting hand-written account by derek patmore, coventry's great grandson, \"coventry patmore's unhappy love for alice meynell\"). a year and a half after marianne died in 1880 patmore married his third wife harriet georgina robson who bore him his seventh child. patmore died on 26 november, 1896. title page of privately printed copy of \"amelia\" (1878) among the patmore manuscripts in burns is a beautiful, privately printed, green colored copy of amelia that is inscribed to edmund gosse. its multi-colored title page adorned with roses is particularly fine. there are signed manuscripts of \"the day after tomorrow,\" \"let be,\" and \"wind and wave\", the third, fourth and ninth sections respectively of the unknown eros . there is also a signed manuscript of patmore's prose essay \"dieu et ma dame,\" the last chapter of his religio poetae . in addition, the burns material includes signed manuscripts of the essays \"on obscure books\" and \"peace in life and art.\" the papers also include an unsigned manuscript of patmore's major poetical work the unknown eros . patmore is, of course, best known today as a poet and man of letters. however, his interest in science was serious. among the burns material is a fascinating hand-written notebook detailing his scientific thoughts for the years 1839 to 1843. the first page heading reads: \"original notes on chemistry and general science by c. k. d. patmore\". also among the papers is a very interesting undated hand-written \"notes of conversation\" which are patmore's own autobiographical notes. the opening sentence catches the eye: \"until i was about eleven years old, i was what is now called an \"agnostic\", that is, i neither knew nor cared whether there was a god or no.\" angel in the house collated with the mss by shane leslie. this includes several handwritten pages of commentary by leslie. this is essentially an encomium of patmore together with mordant criticism of some of patmore's contemporaries. of angel in the house leslie writes: of that marvelous epic, the supreme matrimonial classic, the several delight of emerson, carlyle, newman and ruskin, little remains to be said. tennyson solemnly declared that it was 'an immortal poem' adding to the world's slight store of great poetry. it was a poem needing a lover's as well as a husband's appreciation. it was more than ruskin's 'sweet analysis of quiet domestic feeling,' for ruskin was scarcely a lover or a husband. still less carlyle, who only found what was 'quaintly comfortable' therein. it needed a woman to see the passages were 'so poignant that their pain and pleasure are more than the reader expects from poetry, more than many a reader expects from life.' yet no poet was more ridiculed among the victorians. leslie goes on to lampoon swinburne who was deeply critical of angel in the house swinburne, who hymned lascivious leanings and was incapable of love either sacred or profane, wrote a comic version of the angel in the same taste that might produce a comic prayer book. the poet's reply to parody was sublime. he wrote the odes which defy parody. the unknown eros left swinburne panting in his gilded brothel... undated framed photograph of marianne caroline patmore i shall be in town the end of this week and will finish what is wanting to mrs. patmore's portrait. i shall return again to this place, where we hope to entertain you some day in this coming month. you will i am sure be delighted with the house and country about it. if i should not happen to meet you, you shall have a clear written direction how to find us out. i have finished the background for ophelia, and hope to commence another scene next week. i have been reading in memoriam and it appears to me to be the most godlike work since the bible. rossetti in an undated letter to patmore writes: i have not been very well-at least, have been suffering continual pain from quite a week from neuralgia. i should before this have written to you and returned the proofs. i hope that i'm getting better now-though not quite yet... on 6 february, 1875 matthew arnold wrote to patmore about a mix-up regarding the latter's address: i got your note on my return home late last night. i should be very glad to see you again, and very glad to meet mr worsley, whom i missed, i am sorry to say, when he called upon me; and last night i fully intended to look in for an hour this evening, though not before nine o'clock, as i am engaged to dinner at 7. but now comes my difficulty: this morning your note can nowhere be found, and after a long search i am obliged to come to the conclusion that the housemaid has burnt it. i remember your street, and therefore i hope this will reach you, but i cannot remember your number, and your name is not in the new court guide. so, if this reaches you by 1 or 2 o'clock pray let me have one line to say to what number i am to come; if i do not hear from you, and do not arrive, you will know the reason. in that case give my very kind regards to mr worsley. on 15 oct, 1892 patmore wrote to edmund gosse about consideration for the poet laureateship: thank you for your very friendly mention of me in your article on the laureateship. i have always considered it to be so out of the question that it should be offered to me that i have never even considered what i should do if it were. i am glad that you advocate the claims of austin dobson. his appointment would satisfy every body. certainly it would me. i missed meeting you at tennyson's funeral by the accident of the invitation reaching me too late. i was staying in london, and the ticket was sent to hastings and thence to lymington, and thence to town, where it found me just an hour too late. the burns patmore collection also contains numerous other letters neither to nor from patmore. these include letters from matthew arnold, edward george bulwer-lytton, thomas dequincey, james anthony froude, james leigh hunt, william savage landor, frederick marryat, walter horatio pater, arthur quiller-couch, alfred tennyson, among many others. coventry patmore is one of the least known victorian poets and writers today. some critics argue that this is unfair as his work, despite certain subject matter that was probably more congenial to earlier victorian readers, deserves wider attention. it is also high time that a new biography be written of this complex literary figure. for anyone wishing to be become better acquainted with patmore and his work, his papers in burns library are an excellent place to start. brendan rapple collection development librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter archives : boston college

volume 14 number 3 summer 2013 the levantine review: the work of the managing editor in the fall 2012 issue of the library newsletter we announced the launch of the levantine review - a new open access journal co-sponsored by the boston college libraries and the slavic and eastern languages department (sell). the review is dedicated to the study of the levant from multiple perspectives, including history, theology, religion, linguistics, archaeology, political science, etc. as open access (oa) is becoming more and more important in academic publishing, librarians are increasingly involved with supporting it in many different ways: from advocating for both disciplinary and institutional depositories (such as escholarship@bc) to promoting faculty publishing in oa journals. in this article, focusing on one way librarians can get involved with oa, i wish to share my experience of an open access scholarly journal's managing editor responsibilities. it will be appropriate to emphasize that the experience discussed by no means describes or covers all managing editors' job responsibilities - i'm concerned with my specific experience with a job that started from zero and shaped itself on the go. the o'neill library and sell (franck salameh is editor-in-chief) started the journal in may 2012 and one of the first steps for me as managing editor was to contact publishers to request appropriate books for reviewing to be sent out to reviewers. generally there is a designated person who handles such requests in publishing companies and big publishers usually have \"review copies\" contact information available on their websites. once the copy is obtained, it is sent to the scholar in a relevant field. in many cases scholars proactively notify us about their desire to review particular books, so it is just a matter of providing them with the copy. occasionally publishers ask as a courtesy to share book reviews with them once published and some demonstrate further interest in their books being reviewed by our journal by sending along catalogs with new publications. review one reviewer denied any scholarly value to the work while the other praised and highly recommended it for publication. given that all reviewers are important and well established scholars in the field, it was an interesting and challenging situation and having an odd number of opinions was helpful. it is up to the journal how to share reviews with the authors. they can be sent verbatim, or reworked and include additional recommendations by journal editors, but the important condition of anonymity can never be jeopardized. normally article authors are asked to review recommendations and respond within a certain period of time. based on the limited experience that we have had, all authors have been receptive to the recommendations, mostly following the suggestions, and making requested changes. once all book reviews and original articles are collected, proofread, and formatted, we download them in the local ojs (open journal system) software and make them available for viewing on the web. the next issue, the third one, of the levantine review will be published later this month and the number of contributions to the journal keeps growing. we have authors from canada, poland, sweden, lebanon, israel, and france. the geography is constantly expanding and we are truly excited to make high level scholarship on some very important subject areas openly available to anyone in the world with internet connection and interest in the subject. nina bogdanovsky

newsletter - summer 2013 volume 14 number 3 summer 2013 teaching and learning at the burns library recently, the burns library has been making large strides in integrating special collections materials into the boston college curriculum. during the fall 2012 and spring 2013 semesters, we've reached 25 classes and 950 students here at boston college. a significant number of students know how to find the burns library, have learned about the kinds of materials available and are now more familiar with how to do research in a special collections library. as a result of our efforts, we've developed two very successful instructional models. these models, along with a few examples and learning goals, are described in more detail below. however, the models listed are only a few examples of how burns library materials can be used in a classroom setting. for an informative and visually appealing example of how students have used burns library materials in the classroom, visit the exhibit making history public: books around the world 1400 - 1800 , in the history department, stokes 3rd floor south. this exhibit was curated and organized by professor virginia reinburg's fall 2012 hs600 students, in collaboration with the boston college university libraries. exhibit field trip a faculty member works with a burns staff member to choose items (books and/or manuscripts) that would be suitable for display in an exhibit case located in the burns library. professors write an assignment based on the materials in this exhibit. students either visit the burns library independently to complete this assignment and/or come as a group led by the faculty member or their graduate teaching assistants. this method proved an effective way to reach hundreds of students that smaller spaces in burns would not otherwise be able to accommodate. learning goals: students become familiar with different formats of materials held by special collections, e.g. letters, books, diaries etc. faculty members serve as ambassadors to special collections by advocating student use of special collections materials. faculty members and students learn that the burns library has primary source material that supports their research. recent examples: in fall 2012, sarah ross's history 035 core class looked at books that illustrated the history of bookmaking, printing and science. in spring 2013, stacey barone's introduction to professional nursing class looked at florence nightingale letters and memorabilia from the josephine a. dolan collection of nursing history. in spring 2013, thomas dodman's class looked at letters from famine ireland in the prendergast family correspondence. customized class session a faculty member or graduate student instructor works with a burns staff member to select burns materials that are most relevant to his/her course content. the session's structure, content and length are built by the faculty member and the burns staff member and can often be reused if the course is taught again. these sessions usually include a general introduction to archival research, how to do research at burns, and the collections at the burns library. learning goals: students learn how to use holmes to search for burns library materials. students learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources. students learn the policies and procedures they need to follow when doing research in the burns library reading room. guided by the faculty member and/or burns staff member, students learn to examine special collections materials (archival documents, books, etc.) analytically. recent examples: in fall 2012, holly vande wall's history of science class looked at important books from the history of science. in spring 2013, owen stanwood's hs300 \"europe and the age of 'discovery'\" class examined geographical works from 1400 - 1800. in spring 2013, lauren ravalico's rl455 \"exoticism, ethnography, empire\" class perused 18th and 19th century books by authors volney, lamartine and flaubert. if you have questions or are interested in building a special collections component for a class, then e-mail us at burnsref@bc.edu . you can also find

twice.\" new federal grant requirements are coming. this spring our federal government took two important, coordinated steps toward universal open access to federally-funded research. first came the introduction of a bipartisan bill - in both the house and senate, called the fair access to science and technology research act (fastr) . the acronym evokes the frustrations of many whose research is held up for years in the publication process and then is surrounded by pay walls that block dissemination of knowledge and ideas to taxpayers who paid for the original research. fastr is similar to frpaa , a bill introduced three times in congress but never taken to a vote. fastr is frpaa's stronger brother. it builds on the successful mandate adopted by the nih a few years ago. it extends the policy across all federal agencies that spend more than $100 million in grant funding to support research. it requires that, as a condition of the grant, any scholarly articles published on the basis of the research be deposited in an open access repository within 6 months (shorter than the year that nih allowed). fastr gives agencies one year from passage to come up with policies that meet the guidelines laid out in the bill. the bill calls for the affected agencies to develop coordinated policies, which should both reduce the burdens and increase the incidence of compliance. two important characteristics of the bill are that, unlike recommendations recently made in the uk , authors are not required to publish in open access journals - they can publish anywhere, but must deposit in an open access repository. additionally, the articles must be included on terms that allow for re-use; the versions deposited in repositories and made oa shall be distributed \"in formats and under terms that enable productive reuse, including computational analysis by state-of-the-art technologies.\" ten u.s. library associations, publishers and public interest groups supported the bill via an open letter to one of the sponsors. they stated: timely, barrier-free access to the results of federally funded research is an essential component of our collective investment in science. we fully agree that this information should be shared in cost-effective ways that take advantage of newly available technologies - especially computational technologies such as text and data mining. the increased sharing and use of this information will help to advance the pace of discovery, as well as to speed the translation of this knowledge into innovative new services and products - fueling economic growth, and helping to create jobs. in response to the opinions expressed, one week after fastr was introduced the ostp issued its own directive to the same group of federal agencies affected by fastr, requiring them to: develop a plan to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the federal government. this includes any results published in peer-reviewed scholarly publications that are based on research that directly arises from federal funds... it is preferred that agencies work together, where appropriate, to develop these plans. agencies are given 6 months from the date of the directive to develop the plans. no action is required by congress for this to take effect - the agencies must develop plans to share this research by 6 months from the date of the directive. the directive includes not only scientific peer reviewed publications but also research data. so - do we still need fastr to pass? yes. the ostp directive is an executive branch action. it could be wiped out by the next administration. evaluates the importance of the directive : the directive is big in its own right, and even bigger when put together with fastr. it means that the executive branch is joining the legislative branch in trying to assure oa to federally-funded research. we haven't had that before. convergent effort from two branches of government is a sign that the tide has turned on us public policy. the directive is also important because it's an action. while we debate fastr, the white house directive is already taking effect. it's not a mere proposal. by next summer all of the largest federal funding agencies will have draft oa policies ready for review and implementation. this is seriously good for researchers, good for taxpayers, and good for everyone who depends on research for new medicines, useful technologies, or effective public policies. like fastr, the directive would mandate deposit and access through a repository, rather than through oa journals, but the directive would allow a 12 month embargo period, longer than the 6 months fastr allows. \"in short, the directive has the advantages of certainty and speed, and fastr, if passed, would have the advantage of permanence or longevity.\" ( suber ) in a recent opinion piece , republican representative jim sensenbrenner succinctly expressed why it is time to provide public access to research: no one likes paying for the same thing twice. this holds true for federally funded scientific research. for years, scholarly journals have relied on taxpayers paying for research on the front end and access to the results on the back. it is past time to embrace an open access policy for scientific research. in fiscal year 2012, washington spent nearly $139 billion of taxpayer money on federal research and development activities \u0097 a significant investment in the age of record deficits, growing debt and an ill-advised sequester. but despite substantial spending on research, american taxpayers do not have adequate access to the results of their investment. we can't know if fastr will pass, but taken together with the ostp directive, there is strong and unprecedented bipartisan support for opening federally funded research. regardless of the passage or defeat of fastr, agencies will need to develop policies by late august requiring grantees to make their funded research output public. boston college grant recipients will need to be aware of these developments and ready to comply. the boston college libraries are watching the situation closely and will continue to help faculty with compliance in any way we can, from navigating the regulations and crafting data management plans to hosting scholarly output in escholarship@bc . jane morris

imperative in 1994, i became practically acquainted with the notion of \"open access\" (oa), namely the goal of making scholarship, particularly scholarly journal articles, freely available to anyone with internet access. in that year i published an article in the peer reviewed journal education policy analysis archives , an oa journal. the journal was new, only started the year earlier, and was not particularly well known (though it has subsequently evolved into a very prestigious education journal). within weeks of my article appearing, its subject a fairly obscure topic in nineteenth century english educational history, i was amazed to see that it had been accessed hundreds and hundreds of times. today this figure has reached many thousands. the lesson was plain for me \u0097 if i wished an article to reach as many as possible the strategy was to publish it in an oa journal rather than one closed to most potential readers by subscription barriers. today faculty are increasingly aware of the benefits of open access as well as the disadvantages of closed access. indeed, some experience the irony that sometimes they cannot access their own published work as their institution cannot afford to subscribe to the particular journal. moreover, many are also cognizant that costly financial barriers to journal access at other libraries result in their articles being read less and cited less. such access barriers certainly affect students too, many of whom are strong supporters of oa. the student-founded right to research coalition has as its primary goal \"to promote an open scholarly publishing system based on the belief that no student should be denied access to the articles they need because their institution cannot afford the often high cost of access.\" the coalition presently represents seven million students both nationally and globally. world bank group president robert b. zoellick stated that \"knowledge is power. making our knowledge widely and readily available will empower others to come up with solutions to the world's toughest problems.\" in addition to the social justice aspect of sharing research it is good foreign policy by developed nations to do so. moreover, by disseminating and making available information in a more equitable manner, oa is a powerful force to advance democracy and society's political wellbeing. it is important to point out that boston college library was an early signatory of the 2002 budapest open access initiative that promoted the public good of open access. this public good, the initiative stated, \"is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds. removing access barriers to this literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.\" boston college library is also a member of the alliance for taxpayer access , a body whose primary goal is \"to ensure that the published results of research funded with public dollars are made available to the american public, for free, online, as soon as possible.\" though most oa discussion is focused on journal articles, in recent years a swiftly growing concern is that of open access to research data. increasing the open availability of research data has the potential for a major impact on the advancement of critical, global scientific research efforts by simplifying the process and lowering the costs of exchange and reuse of valuable data sets. the data underlying the research of many journal articles has also been funded from public sources. more and more individuals, viewing this as a social justice issue, want this data to be freely available to the taxpayer. though the scholar may have collected, analyzed, evaluated the research data, a strong case can be made that it does not belong to her and should be made public and shared. the researcher is usually only a steward of the data. a number of major funding agencies now mandate that data be made public to a greater or lesser degree, for example the national institutes of health ( data sharing required for grants exceeding $500,000); the national endowment for the humanities (the neh has a particularly robust data management plan) ; the centers for disease control and prevention ; the department of education, institute of education sciences . the national science foundation has required from january 2011 that grant proposals include a \"data management plan\" that specifies sharing of data : \"investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of work under nsf grants. grantees are expected to encourage and facilitate such sharing.\" the sharing of such data, not just to other academic researchers but to all, can go far in furthering many facets of the public good. some scholars are still leery of oa. it's a relatively new concept that upends what has been for years the traditional dissemination of scholarship. it's true that many authors are loyal to the existing subscription journals which they have known and maybe published in for years. also, there are a number of myths associated with oa (see the article \" open access myths: busted! \" by my colleague jane morris) not least of which is that oa journals do not practice peer review or that some lesser peer review is performed in oa journals. this oft cited absence of peer review is just plain wrong. there are good quality peer reviewed oa journals as well as mediocre peer-reviewed oa journals as is the case with subscription journals. the quality of journals has nothing necessarily to do with whether they're free or subscription. there is no reason whatsoever that an oa journal must be more lacking in academic and editorial rigor than its toll-access counterparts. still, as oa journals are a somewhat new phenomenon it's understandable if many seeking tenure or other decisions affecting their career tend to eschew publishing in such media. they are worried that the decision makers may be ignorant of the nature of oa. of course much of this attitude is discipline based. there tends to be far more knowledge about oa in, for example, some of the sciences - physics is to the fore as is medicine. of the social sciences economics enjoys the most practice of oa. nevertheless, scholars' leeriness regarding oa is disappearing. a growing number are careful when signing copyright agreements to seek to retain sufficient rights to place the published work on their personal web pages and in such disciplinary oa digital archives as the scientific arxiv.org or the economics repec or in such oa institutional repositories as bc's escholarship@bc . numerous others are publishing in such free oa journals as the 9,000 listed in the directory of open access journals or paying, if funds permit and policies allow, for their articles in regular journals to be available as oa. one can assume that more and more authors appreciate the patent advantages of oa in disseminating their scholarship as well as the ensuing benefits of wider readership. while scholars are pleased with oa for professional reasons, it is likely that many also subscribe to the social justice aspect of oa. they want their research to make a difference, to help society. it makes no sense, certainly no ethical sense, to keep research closed by means of publisher financial gateways from vast numbers of the world's population who would benefit from such research. recognizing that knowledge is a public good and not a mere commodity, more and more agree that it should be free as well as easily accessible, that providing open access to knowledge is, in short, the right thing to do. brendan rapple collection

the john j. burns library jen o'brien '13 and juliette san fillipo '13, bookbuilders of boston scholarship recipients, have been working as interns at the john j. burns library this semester. bookbuilders of boston, a non-profit organization founded in 1937, has a membership representing all areas of the book industry: editing, design, production, manufacturing, and marketing. this organization created a scholarship fund to support, encourage, and promote publishing-related education. participating educational institutions, such as boston college, award the scholarships to students who plan to pursue careers in publishing anticipating that, upon graduation, they will contribute their knowledge and unique talent to the field. juliette san fillipo jen o'brien juliette and jen were an excellent fit for this program; they already have strong backgrounds in publication through campus organizations such as: the heights , elements , laughing medusa , and stylus . their time in the burns library has been filled with training by colleagues in all departments, and includes a major assignment issued by bridget burke, associate university librarian for special collections. this article is focused on the conservation department portion of the students' training, the \"my book\" project, and the collaboration with the boston college integrated sciences cleanroom and nanofabrication facility. the \"my book\" project was envisioned as a format for the two students to learn about historic book structure in an engaged way\u0097each was assigned a particular book to study and describe in a paper as they learned the process of making a hand-crafted book. jen o'brien had already been working as a burns library aide prior to her selection as a bookbuilders of boston intern, so her interest in 16th century books bound in pigskin was known. her book, titled , was printed in 1593 and is bound in pigskin. juliette san fillipo has a deep interest in sustainable living and re-purposed materials, so she was given a book with a \"re-cycled\" medieval manuscript as the cover, titled appendix ad grammaticum proteum de alphonsi de vargas . both students were given book history reading assignments, met with barbara, the conservator, to discuss the structure of their books, and then wrote papers outlining their findings. jen and juliette, in addition to receiving instruction in the conservation lab, also spent considerable time with david richtmyer, rare books librarian and senior cataloger, learning rare book cataloging and early printing processes, thereby rounding out their knowledge of the assigned books. they did an excellent job of researching historic books, but were also eager to find out facts specific to their books. their books, as well as an 18th century book in the process of being repaired in the lab, all had in common some sort of red pigment on their surfaces. juliette's book has bold red initial letters on the vellum leaf covering it, jen's book has deep red colored residue on the leather, and the 18th century book has some bright red lettering. their interest was also piqued by a red ink recipe in the 18th century book. was it used to create the red color of the lettering? the surest way to know the chemical makeup of these red pigments was to do materials analysis. dr. greg mcmahon, multibeam fib/sem research associate at the boston college integrated sciences cleanroom and nanofabrication facility, had collaborated with the burns library conservation department on other book history projects and graciously aided it again. a sem image from one of the flecks of juliette's samples of ink from appendix ad grammaticum proteum de alphonsi de vargas is shown in figure 1. figure 1: sem image from ink from appendix ad grammaticum proteum de alphonsi de vargas. the 200um bar shown represents the size of about 2-3 human hair diameters. the area outlined by the pink box represents the region where we performed x-ray analysis. the resulting x-ray spectrum is shown in figure 2. here, the x- or horizontal axis represents the energy of the detected x-ray in kev, and the y- or vertical axis represents the number of those x-rays detected. figure 2: eds spectrum showing x-ray peaks corresponding to x-rays from elements in the sample. carbon (c) and oxygen (o) are frequently found in many materials, but most interesting are the mercury (hg) and sulfur (s) peaks. the identification of strong peaks from both mercury and sulfur is an indication of the presence of the pigment vermillion in the sample - a red pigment known to be in frequent use at the time (and before) this particular \"recycled\" cover was made. jen's book also showed the presence of strong hg and s peaks, indicating the use of vermillion, but also of other interesting materials such as barium sulfide, which may have been used as a pigment, but may also have been used to treat the pig's hide. finally, the lettering on the manuscript barbara had been working on was also definitively vermillion. so although this manuscript gave a recipe for a red ink made of organic materials (containing alum which would have easily been spotted), the red ink used in the manuscript was clearly vermillion. in all of the samples analyzed, the sulfide mineral known as cinnabar would have produced the red color for the vermillion pigment. the results that dr. mcmahon determined using the cleanroom equipment came as a surprise to the students because the three reds appeared, to the human eye, to be entirely different shades of red and therefore could have been made from different materials. without the materials analysis, they would have had to identify the reds visually and by investigating what materials would have been available historically. the ink for 18th century lettering might have been assumed to have been made from the recipe in that book. the cleanroom visit helped the interns to learn to investigate using all methods available; the library, in this case, served to make the connection. at boston college the bookbuilders of boston interns, jen o'brien and juliette san fillipo, had a unique library training experience. while assisting with all the burns library staff, the interns learned the daily workings of a special collections library. the conservation department, in assigning them the \"my book\" project, gave them the opportunity to learn historic book structure by focusing on one book intensively while using the library's resources. the collaboration with the boston college integrated sciences cleanroom and nanofabrication facility allowed juliette and jen to learn specific details about their books and enhanced their \"my book\" project in a meaningful way. so that a wider audience can share in greater detail what the students learned, their papers are posted on the burns library blog . dr. greg mcmahon multibeam fib/sem research associate barbara adams hebard

teaching (act) for the past two years, the connors family learning center (cflc) has offered a new program for graduate student teaching assistants and fellows. the apprenticeship in college teaching was developed with the office of the provost and with input from departments and is designed to prepare graduate students for teaching at bc and in their future careers. students can combine training offered by their departments with the cflc seminars to cover a range of teaching topics. those who complete the program receive a certificate from the office of the provost for inclusion in their teaching portfolios. the program is very flexible and students can complete the requirements in one year or over the course of two or even three years. the first step is to file a plan with the cflc, including goals and a proposed timeline for completing the program components: attend a teaching orientation, held at the beginning of each academic year. attend five required workshops, plus two electives. the required workshops cover: classroom management syllabus design grading creating a teaching portfolio conducting a teaching observation. write a course syllabus. observe and be observed teaching build a teaching portfolio that includes a reflective statement of teaching philosophy, a cv, samples of work (e.g., exercises, exams, writing assignments), observations and evaluations. all participants have the option of creating an electronic version of the portfolio. the teaching portfolio is probably the most valuable part of the act. like the program overall, the portfolios have the dual purposes of preparing graduate students to be better teachers at bc and helping them prepare for the job search and interviews. just the process of creating the portfolio helps a teacher become more reflective and better prepared for future teaching and for talking about teaching. here are some examples of online teaching portfolios from students in the act program:

http://mhooperteachingportfolio.wordpress.com/ the act program has grown considerably since its beginning in the fall of 2011. last year, 16 students earned certificates. currently, over 100 students are enrolled in the act and 36 expect to finish this semester or over the summer. although many participants come from arts and sciences and the lynch school of education, all the bc schools are represented (gssw, law, csom and cson). several students have told us that the portfolios were mentioned positively on job interviews, as evidence of teaching experience and commitment to developing as a teacher. if you have questions about the act or would like to direct students to the program, please go to our web site or contact sue barrett sue barrett director, the connors family learning

communication and open access scholarly communication has been a buzz phrase in libraries and universities for the past decade, with as many interpretations as interlocutors. for us at boston college libraries, our initial foray into this world explored whether a paradigm shift was occurring, with content produced by professors and researchers moving from traditional publications to \"open access\" resources. frankly, this early focus was on whether scholarship could be made more cost effective, because the current model where faculty produce research and publishers make huge profits selling it back to university libraries cannot be sustained economically. recently, our analysis suggests that open access will not result in substantial cost savings without several truly radical developments. these developments range from changes in the promotion and tenure process to the rethinking of the academic journal as the primary source of scholarly output. ultimately, such changes are faculty dependent, and without faculty buy-in, the current system perpetuates. on a related point, people sometimes ask why librarians care so deeply about these issues. librarians have long held a very jeffersonian viewpoint in their staunch support of \"freedom of information\" as absolutely essential for an informed electorate, the foundation of our democratic society. consequently, the idea of \"open access\" within the milieu of scholarly communication has not been a hard sell for librarians. at boston college libraries the support of open access runs even deeper, as we equate the jesuit mission of social justice to the concept of open access. thus far, my experiences at boston college have not shown any broad interest in open access, with several notable exceptions. a range of very reasonable circumstances contributes to these lacunae. however, the single biggest reason seems to be that researchers do not have time or incentive to educate themselves about open access issues. clearly, the boston college libraries have more work to do. many of our peer and aspirant universities have already had campus-wide conversations about open access, and many of them have a process (or policy) to have scholarship and research produced at their universities openly accessible via their institutional repository. moreover, many publishers allow for open access, either within the university or to the world, as well as providing some room for negotiation with regard to copyright. as all of you realize, we have an incredibly intelligent and dedicated staff of librarians at the boston college libraries. their work entails instruction, collection building, subject based research guides, research consultations and many \"other duties as assigned\" to assist faculty and students. in the coming year, i am asking them to aggressively promote the myriad of issues and services that fall under the rubric of \"scholarly communication.\" by redoubling our efforts to become more knowledgeable about the wide range of concerns and developments in the area of open access, i hope we can collectively facilitate a better understanding of these important issues and explore ways we can generate a campus discussion about open access. additionally, we will soon be implementing a new platform for escholarship@bc, boston college libraries' institutional repository, and expect to introduce a streamlined process to populate the site with faculty research. so this fall, look for a renewed emphasis on scholarly communication and open access, as well as exciting developments in the affinity area of digital scholarship, as we continue in our aspiration to \"add value beyond discovery.\" as always, please feel free to contact me with concerns, suggestions and ideas. thank you all for another wonderful year, and best wishes for a restful and prosperous summer. tom wall university librarian questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter

about literature and politics at boston college mikhail pavlovich shishkin on 23 april boston college libraries and the slavic and eastern languages department co-sponsored a reading and discussion event with mikhail shishkin, a russian author. mikhail shishkin is widely considered to be one of the most important russian-language novelists of the post-soviet era. he is the only contemporary russian writer who has won all three major russian literary awards: the russian booker prize, the national bestseller prize, and the big book prize. born in 1961 in moscow, shishkin studied english and german at moscow state pedagogical institute. after graduation he worked as a street sweeper, road worker, journalist, school teacher, and translator. his literary debut happened in 1993 in russia. since 1995 he has been living in switzerland. shishkin's novels have been translated into 27 languages including faroese - a west scandinavian language spoken by only about 70,000 people, most of whom reside on the faroe islands, denmark. a humorous detail here is that \"crime and punishment\" by dostoevsky was the next in line to be translated into faroese. in addition to winning le prix du meilleur livre \u00e9tranger - a french literary prize that is awarded yearly for the best fiction translated into french -- shishkin also received the preis des hauses der kulturen der welt in berlin - a literary award for contemporary fiction in german translation. while well known on the international literary scene, shishkin's recognition in the english-speaking literary world has lagged behind due to the unavailability of his books in english. this situation is rapidly changing. in the fall of 2012, open letter books published shishkin's best-known award winning novel \"maidenhair\". later this year, his most recent, and also award winning, novel \"the light and the dark\" will be released in the u.s. the reactions to these english translations have been very positive. according to the guardian , shishkin is \"arguably russia's greatest living novelist;\" \"his writing is richly textured and innovative and his themes are universal: love and death, pain and happiness, war and peace.\" a critic in the buffalo news wrote: \"american readers will find him to be a writer of panoramic scale and ambition, a novelist with a sweeping social vision and sense of history reminiscent of 19th century russian realism, but one who employs the narrative techniques of postmodernism and 21st century modernism to stunning effect.\" in february of this year mikhail shishkin outraged the russian government when he refused to represent russia in a major international literary event, the us book expo in new york. in an open letter to the russian press ministry, he declined their invitation, citing russia as \"a country where power has been seized by a corrupt, criminal regime, where the state is a pyramid of thieves.\" during his visit to boston college mikhail shishkin read from his essay \"in a boat scratched on the wall\", sharing his thoughts on language, and living and writing in a foreign country. the reading was followed by an engaging and informative discussion on the state of literature and politics in contemporary russia. nina bogdanovsky subject specialist, o'neill library questions, comments? contact the bc libraries newsletter review board . newsletter

syracuse, ny: syracuse university press, 2007 maxim d. shrayer , professor, department of slavic and eastern languages. in 1987 a young jewish man, the central figure in this captivating book, leaves moscow for good with his parents. they celebrate their freedom in opulent vienna and spend two months in rome and the coastal resort of ladispoli. while waiting in europe for a us refugee visa, the book's twenty-year-old poet quenches his thirst for sexual and cultural discovery. through his colorful austrian and italian misadventures, he experiences the shock, thrill, and anonymity of encountering western democracies, running into european roadblocks while shedding soviet taboos. as he anticipates entering a new life in america, he movingly describes the baggage that exiles bring

"http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2011spring/openaccess/", "text": "boston college libraries newsletter volume 12 number 3 spring 2011 open access myths: busted! brief definition: open-access (oa) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. what makes it possible is the internet and the consent of the author or copyright-holder. peter suber recently the libraries surveyed members of the faculty about their publishing practices. we asked some questions about open access publishing and found that, although many faculty members were receptive to the idea of publishing in open access media, a small percentage have taken advantage of these opportunities to date. many commented that they needed to know more, or were confused by the options. it\u2019s clear that misconceptions and myths about open access have found some currency, so we thought we would address a few of them here: myth: open access is a subversive movement that will ultimately undermine our copyright system. fact: open access works entirely within our current copyright system. your work as an author is copyrighted to you the moment you fix it in a tangible medium of expression (typing it into word and clicking save, for example). you retain that copyright until you give some or all of it away. traditionally, publishers\u2019 contracts required all rights to be transferred to the publisher. this is changing \u2013 publishers and authors are recognizing that it is beneficial for authors to retain some rights. copyright is often described as a bundle of rights \u2013 you can unbundle them, give some away and retain some. you might transfer to the publisher the rights necessary to publish but retain the right to deposit your work in an open access repository. myth: open access will destroy the scholarly publishing system and cause journals to fail. fact: new models are emerging in scholarly publishing. one safeguard that many journals implement is a time-limited embargo on open access. journals recoup most of the publishing costs within the first year of publication. articles can then be made open access without loss of revenue. many journal publishers have also decided to change their business model from subscription-only, cost-recovery, to a hybrid model. hybrid journals charge subscription fees, but recognize that many authors may be committed (or required) to make their publications openly available. these journals charge up-front fees ($1500-$2500 is a common range) for open access articles which appear side by side with subscription-only submissions. blackwell, brill, cambridge, kluwer, oxford, routledge, sage, taylor & francis, and wiley are among the publishers that offer hybrid journal options. many grant-funders require or support the open availability of work based on their funding, and are willing to finance these fees. many universities have established funds to pay the open access fees where no grant funding is available. myth: open access journals are not peer-reviewed and are of low quality. fact: open access journals, just like any other journal, can be peer-reviewed or not, depending on the journal policy. the fact that the journal is open access says nothing about whether it is peer-reviewed. most scholarly open access journals are peer-reviewed. in addition, in hybrid journals (where some articles are open access and some are not) the open access articles are subjected to the same review as the subscription access articles. myth: if i want to publish open access i have to submit my article to an open access journal. fact: you can submit and publish your article in any journal you like and still make it available open access in our research repository, escholarship@bc. you just need to plan for this in advance. you can send the article to escholarship at the same time that you submit it to the journal of your choice, giving bc the right to make it available (subject to an embargo period if you like). universities that have open access policies usually require this (with an opt-out safety valve for authors). or you can, at the time of signing the publishers\u2019 contract, submit a standard addendum that reserves to you the right to deposit your work in escholarship. myth: if i try to retain some rights, publishers will think i am difficult and will not want to publish my work. fact: approximately 60% of academic journals allow some form or open access archiving without any use of an addendum to the contract. for a searchable database of publisher policies about copyright and archiving, explore the sherpa/romeo site. myth: publishing my work open access is a nice, altruistic thing to do, but there is nothing in it for me. fact: open access publishing does help address inequities in access to knowledge globally. few people in the world have access to the resources we have here at boston college. but, in addition, most studies show a clear citation advantage for open access publications. open access publications are cited more often than those that are subscription-only and citation counts are still important factors in tenure and promotion decisions. for more in-depth information about open access publishing, see peter suber\u2019s excellent open access overview and take a look at our copyright and scholarship guide. please

years in the making of this brilliant and extraordinary man and poet. at each step of hopkins's life . . . . mariani shows us a man who always insisted on probing deeper into the mystery of god. in this scintillating analysis of hopkins's poetry and his life, mariani reveals for us the rich and poignant story of a great poet and that rare thing: a good man whose life and words continue to touch and inspire us.\u201d - viking penguin view sample pages comments from paul mariani interview excerpt (8:48 min) full interview (31:18 min) real player required for viewing. boston college libraries

sj, founder of the department of geophysics and director of boston college\u2019s weston observatory, was invited to participate in u.s. navy operation deep freeze to antarctica. over the course of three southern hemisphere summers, he conducted the first seismic ice measurements of the antarctic, determining that rock was reached under a thickness of 8197 feet of ice at the south pole. he also served as catholic chaplain on board the usn atka, participated in the rescue of a dying helicopter pilot, celebrated the first mass at the south pole and delighted in the antics of penguins. his meticulously-written journals detail every aspect of deep freeze life, including capsule reviews of every b movie shown nightly on board to the crew. the us navy awarded fr. linehan the distinguished public service award in 1959 for his work with operation deep freeze, and the linehan glacier was named in his honor. the burns library maintains an extensive collection of fr. linehan\u2019s writings as well as artifacts relating to his religious and scientific work. this exhibit highlights materials representing his work in antarctica. about the o\u2019neill library lobby there are four

much of scotland, parts of northern britain and the isle of man. the term gaelic covers a group of different celtic languages split into two branches. one branch consists of irish gaelic, scots-gaelic, and manx; the other branch, breton, cornish and welsh. with the anglo-norman conquest of ireland in the 12th century, norman-french and english came into use. for a time the english-speaking population lived in an area around dublin known as the pale. outside the pale, native irish language, culture and society continued strongly on its own path until the tudor period when, after a final battle for power, gaelic aristocratic society and order of life collapsed. loss of property, plantation of new settlers from england, and new legal and economic systems made it difficult to conduct everyday affairs in irish. no longer recognized as the official language, irish was discouraged or suppressed. during the 19th century, however, with shifts in power and strong interest in building an irish nation, there were movements in dublin and belfast to revive the irish language. the most significant of these movements was the gaelic league, conradh na gaeilge . the league worked to preserve irish as the national language of ireland, and encourage it as a spoken language. today the irish language is highly valued, taught in irish schools, used for contemporary works of literature and, in the gaeltacht areas, used as everyday speech. this exhibit traces the movement to preserve, learn and promote speaking and writing in irish since the late 19 century. the irish studies program at boston college offers classes in the irish language. dictionaries, grammars, books, cd's and dvd's for practicing conversation or translation are available at the o\u2019neill

o\u2019neill lobby by 1929, when boston college established its first professional school, the institution was already 65 years old. at this time the chestnut hill campus consisted of only four buildings \u2013 the recitation building (gasson hall), st. mary\u2019s hall, the science building (devlin hall), and the library (bapst library) \u2013 and overlooked twin reservoirs. the 1928 boston college directory listed only a college of arts and sciences, a graduate school, and affiliated schools for training members of the society of jesus at west stockbridge and weston. the next year marked a change with the addition of the law school . once the law school was established (1929), other professional schools followed: school of social work (1936) , school of business administration (1938) , school of nursing (1947) , and, finally, the school of education (1952) . with the exception of the school of education, which introduced coeducation on the chestnut hill campus, these boston college programs all had their start in downtown boston. the boston college law school, graduate school of social work, carroll school of management, connell school of nursing, and lynch school of education, as they are now known, are all well-established and well-regarded; this exhibit highlights their beginnings. learn more about the boston college sesquicentennial, the university archives,

1400-1800 april - december 2013 europe experienced a revolution in book production and literacy between 1400 and 1800. we usually assign the start of the revolution to the invention of the printing press by johan gutenberg of mainz (germany), around 1450. but gutenberg fuelled what had already begun: a sizable expansion in the number of handwritten or manuscript books produced, sold, and owned, together with a growth in literacy. manuscripts were handwritten, and thus available in limited numbers of copies. the invention of movable type transformed the book market, dramatically expanding the numbers of editions and individual copies of books. by the early decades of the sixteenth century, multiple publishers had established businesses in every european city. despite the greater availability of books, this was an era of low literacy rates by our standards. but most cities, towns, and villages had a few schools and tutors who taught children and adults to read. books were published in ancient languages like latin, as well as vernacular languages like english, german, french, and spanish. as in europe, large cities in the arab mediterranean world experienced a similar growth in book production and literacy. over the course of the early modern period, books became a key way in which knowledge was transmitted from person to person, community to community, and generation to generation. books are not the only means by which early modern people shared and acquired knowledge. but they offer history students today a good avenue to understanding what people of this era thought was important. about the history department in stokes hall the history department in stokes hall features exhibits collaborated with the boston college libraries for the course hs600

explains how this peaceable kingdom--benevolent, quaker, pacifist--gradually disintegrated in the eighteenth century, with disastrous consequences for native americans. based on extensive research in eighteenth-century primary sources, this engaging history offers an eye-opening look at how colonists--at first, the backwoods paxton boys but later the u.s. government--expropriated native american

punishable by imprisonment. it was only in 1978 that the american indian religious freedom act was passed to guarantee people's right to traditional, tribal belief and practice. so the fact that so

situated at the split between theism and atheism, we now have the opportunity to respond in deeper, freer ways to things we cannot fathom or prove. richard kearney calls this condition ana-theos , or god after god-a moment of creative \u201cnot knowing\u201d that signifies a break with former sureties and invites us to forge new meanings from the most ancient of wisdoms. anatheism refers to an inaugural event that lies at the heart of every great religion, a wager between hospitality and hostility to the stranger, the other\u2014the sense of something \u201cmore.\u201d by analyzing the

david gabai , department of mathematics, princeton university ; robert meyerhoff , department of mathematics, boston college ; peter milley , department of mathematics and statistics, university of melbourne in the 1970's, thurston and j\u00f8rgensen showed that the volumes of orientable finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds form a well-ordered subset of the real numbers. in particular, there is a smallest such volume. around 1985, weeks and matveev-fomenko independently discovered a candidate for a least-volume orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold, which is now commonly termed the weeks manifold. thurston, hodgson-weeks and matveev-fomenko conjectured that low volume implies low combinatorial/topological complexity. it has been a challenge to make this statement precise and to determine the hyperbolic manifolds of smallest volume. the paper under review is a milestone in the study of orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume. the authors depart from traditional measures of topological/combinatorial complexity, which arise from triangulations, heegaard splittings or spines. they not only show that \u201cmom technology\u201d allows a precise formulation of how low volume implies low complexity, but they also demonstrate that this platform allows topological, geometric, combinatorial and computational methods to be entwined in order to produce significant theoretical results. the paper under review is, for example, a key step in the proof of the fact that the weeks manifold is indeed the unique orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold of least volume. it is beyond doubt that the methods and results of this paper will have major impact and lead to further crucial applications. read the article view journal homepage comments from robert meyerhoff boston

stirrings of upheaval took place in the pews, where changes to the mass were felt immediately and viscerally by the faithful. suddenly, one sunday, the mass as they had always known it was very

supposedly commissioned by queen christina of sweden. franco mormando reveals that this biography was actually commissioned by bernini's sons in the 1670s, and was largely based on a biography written by his youngest son, domenico (1657-1723) which remained unpublished until 1713. mormando has translated this invaluable primary source into english for the first time, and presents it here in a

in new and fundamentally different forms - in entrepreneurship, networks, governance, transparency and accountability - already being planted and beginning to grow. to nurture these developments, they

this book argues that most ancient groups appropriated patterns from the state. comparison of the rule scrolls with greco-roman constitutional literature, as well as philosophical, rabbinic, and early christian texts, shows that the sect's appropriation helped articulate an \"alternative civic ideology\" by which members identified themselves as subjects of a commonwealth alternative and superior

minnesota press, 2011 dr. kevin ohi , professor, english department kevin ohi begins this energetic book with the proposition that to read henry james\u2014particularly the late texts\u2014is to confront the queer potential of style and the traces it leaves on the literary life. in contrast to other recent critics, ohi asserts that james\u2019s queerness is to be found neither in the homoerotic thematics of the texts, however startlingly explicit, nor in the suggestions of same-sex desire in the author\u2019s biography, however undeniable, but in his style. for ohi, there are many elements in the style that make james\u2019s writing queer. but if there is a thematic marker, ohi shows through his careful engagements with these texts, it is belatedness. the recurrent concern with belatedness, ohi explains, should be understood not psychologically but stylistically, not as confessing the sad predicament of being out of sync with one\u2019s life but as revealing the consequences of style\u2019s refashioning of experience. belatedness marks life\u2019s encounter with style, and it describes an experience not of deprivation but of the rich potentiality of the literary work that james calls \u201cfreedom.\u201d in ohi\u2019s reading, belatedness is the indicator not of sublimation or repression, nor of authorial self-sacrifice, but of the potentiality of the literary\u2014and hence of the queerness of style. presenting original readings of a series of late jamesian texts, the book also represents an exciting possibility for queer theory and literary studies in the future: a renewed attention to literary form and a new sounding\u2014energized by literary questions of style and form\u2014of the theoretical implications of queerness. view sample pages comments from dr.

building - relationship architecture 3. closing business - the revenue game. in order to ensure that a company maximizes revenue, all three areas must work harmoniously together. the first section \u201cthe marketing playbook\u201d, identifies ways to set up an organization to win and understand preexisting fans of their product - and those who can become ones. it shows how to find those people who are absolutely dying to spend their money on an organization\u2019s product. the key is transferring a business from a transactional to a relationship-oriented marketing model. the second section \u201crelationship architecture\u201d shows how organizations can connect with people in meaningful ways and shows the kind of effort it takes to create significant moments that profoundly change relationships. actual steps are identified that will ensure positive successful relationships and will yield a real change in an organization\u2019s p&l statement. imbriano then shows how he managed

frequently ranked not only as the greatest spanish composer of all time, but also as one of the finest composers of the so-called high renaissance. the new oxford history of music describes the composer in the following terms: \"combining the vocations of priest and musician, victoria created an art of incomparable spirituality.\" for paul henry lang, victoria's requiem (1605) is \"one of the most magnificent compositions of the entire choral literature.\" this colossus of priest-composers was born in \u00e1vila, the birthplace of st teresa (1515-82); he was educated at the colegio san gil, a school founded by the society of jesus in 1554, the very same school, in fact, that st teresa herself insisted her nephews attend. as a teenager, victoria was sent to the jesuit german college in rome, thus becoming the first truly great composer to be associated with the jesuits. it is in victoria's treatment of the latin liturgical texts that he chose to set to music that we witness a compositional mind acutely aware of the possibilities of symbolic interpretation, multi-layered allusion, and textual exegesis. far from simple text-expression, we are dealing here with compositional refinement of extraordinary sophistication. this 10 cd compendium of victoria's sacred music focuses on works from the period of victoria's maturity, when he was composing in madrid, together with a number of versions of his works that have never previously been recorded. the boxed set contains over 90 works and represents the culmination of a project that involved a total of 42 musicians from more than five countries who worked for a total of seventy days throughout a two year period to bring the project to a magnificent conclusion. listen to sample recordings incipit oratio jeremiae: cd2

university press of america, 2012 dr. eileen c. sweeney , philosophy department anselm of canterbury is an important and early source of two key themes in western thought and religion that are hard to reconcile. in his arguments based only on reason, anselm develops a model of pure and neutral rationality. in his intensely personal and passionate prayers, meditations, and letters of spiritual direction, anselm is the forerunner of later experiential and emotional spirituality. scholars have been largely content to compartmentalize these different elements in anselm, but his most famous works, the monologion and proslogion, are both prayerful meditations and argumentative assays of \"reason alone.\" any account of anselm as a thinker or of his place in western intellectual and religious history must make sense of this enigma. in anselm of canterbury and the desire for the word , eileen c. sweeney addresses these tensions, offering a new cumulative and comparative interpretation of anselm's writings. she finds common concerns and patterns across his prayers, logical analysis, and christological and trinitarian speculation. sweeney argues that seeing the common structure and goal in the many topics and genres in the anselmian corpus yields a new way of considering much-discussed questions in anselm scholarship--the relationship of faith and reason, the search for \"necessary reasons,\" the concurrence of freedom and grace. it also sheds further light on anselm's engagement with non-christian objectors and on the emotional content of anselm's prayers and letters. sweeney's study offers a comprehensive picture of anselm's thought and its development, from the early, intimate, monastically based meditations to the later, public, proto-scholastic disputations. she reveals anselm as a thinker as relentless in his exposure of ambiguity, paradox, and separation as in his pursuit of certainty, necessity, and unity. view sample pages comments from

organizations like corporations, hospitals, and universities. drawing on numerous in-depth surveys of members of the public as well as the largest database of interest organizations ever created--representing more than thirty-five thousand organizations over a twenty-five-year period--this book conclusively demonstrates that american democracy is marred by deeply ingrained and persistent class-based political inequality. the well educated and affluent are active in many ways to make their voices heard, while the less advantaged are not. this book reveals how the political voices of organized interests are even less representative than those of individuals, how political advantage is handed down across generations, how recruitment to political activity perpetuates and exaggerates existing biases, how political voice on the internet replicates these inequalities--and more. in a true democracy, the preferences and needs of all citizens deserve equal consideration.

universe unraveling: american foreign policy in cold war laos by dr. seth jacobs cornell university press, 2012. dr. seth jacobs , history department during the eisenhower and kennedy administrations, laos was positioned to become a major front in the cold war. yet american policymakers ultimately chose to resist communism in neighboring south vietnam instead. two generations of historians have explained this decision by citing logistical considerations. laos's landlocked, mountainous terrain, they hold, made the kingdom an unpropitious place to fight, while south vietnam\u2014possessing a long coastline, navigable rivers, and all-weather roads\u2014better accommodated america's military forces. the universe unraveling is a provocative reinterpretation of u.s.-laos relations in the years leading up to the vietnam war. seth jacobs argues that laos boasted several advantages over south vietnam as a battlefield, notably its thousand-mile border with thailand, whose leader was willing to allow washington to use his nation as a base from which to attack the communist pathet lao. more significant in determining u.s. policy in southeast asia than strategic appraisals of the laotian landscape were cultural perceptions of the lao people. jacobs contends that u.s. policy toward laos under eisenhower and kennedy cannot be understood apart from the traits americans ascribed to their lao allies. drawing on diplomatic correspondence and the work of iconic figures like \"celebrity saint\" tom dooley, jacobs finds that the characteristics american statesmen and the american media attributed to the lao\u2014laziness, immaturity, and cowardice\u2014differed from the traits assigned the south vietnamese, making lao chances of withstanding communist aggression appear dubious. the universe unraveling combines diplomatic, cultural, and military history to provide a new perspective on how prejudice can shape policy decisions and even the course of history. view

service process, not only through self-service but also by providing information to the service provider to create a more personalized service experience. designing service processes to unlock value explores how service processes can be designed to leverage the expanding range of opportunities for service providers and customers to co-create value. view sample pages comments from dr. joy m. field

in light of the idiomatic meaning of the rubric by dr. christopher g. frechette m\u00fcnster: ugarit-verlag, 2012 dr. christopher g. frechette , school of theology and ministry this book is about a rubric that names a class of ritual-prayers written in cuneiform, but the rubric and the rituals are about something much less esoteric: the role of recognition in a human's relationship with the divine. in mesopotamian culture, to lift the hand to the deity expressed one\u2019s desire for and anticipation of the deity\u2019s recognition, affirming a favorable relationship with the deity, and that relationship was characterized not only by the obvious asymmetry, but also by reciprocity. this study covers an array of linguistic and visual sources relevant to understanding the conventional exchange of gestures of recognition between subordinates and authorities, whether human or divine. it brings these to bear on other sources related to the enactment of a particular family of \"hand-lifting\" rituals intended to establish such recognition. those rituals were enacted in order to address concerns arising from events that called into question one\u2019s relationship with the divine and sought to heal that relationship. read a review of dr. frechette\u2019s book in orientalia ns 81 (2012): 264-266. view sample pages comments from dr. frechette boston college libraries

better students for life by dr. peter gray basic books, 2013 dr. peter gray , research professor, psychology department our children spend their days being passively instructed, and made to sit still and take tests-often against their will. we call this imprisonment schooling, yet wonder why kids become bored and misbehave. even outside of school children today seldom play and explore without adult supervision, and are afforded few opportunities to control their own lives. the result: anxious, unfocused children who see schooling-and life-as a series of hoops to struggle through. in free to learn, developmental psychologist peter gray argues that our children, if free to pursue their own interests through play, will not only learn all they need to know, but will do so with energy and passion. children come into this world burning to learn, equipped with the curiosity, playfulness, and sociability to direct their own education. yet we have squelched such instincts in a school model originally developed to indoctrinate, not to promote intellectual growth. to foster children who will thrive in today's constantly changing world, we must entrust them to steer their own learning and development. drawing on evidence from anthropology, psychology, and history, gray demonstrates that free play is the primary means by which children learn to control their lives, solve problems, get along with peers, and become emotionally resilient. this capacity to learn through play evolved long ago, in hunter-gatherer bands where children acquired the skills of the culture through their own initiatives. and these instincts still operate remarkably well today, as studies at alternative, democratically administered schools show. when children are in charge of their own education, they learn better-and at lower cost than the traditional model of coercive schooling. a brave, counterintuitive proposal for freeing our children from the shackles of the curiosity-killing institution we call school, free to learn suggests that it's time to stop asking what's wrong with our children, and start asking what's wrong with the system. it shows how we can act-both as parents and as members of society-to improve children's lives and promote their happiness and learning. view sample pages comments from dr. peter gray boston college libraries resources find this book in the library view a

ground-breaking book, based on archival and field research and previously unknown historical evidence, maxim d. shrayer introduces the work of ilya selvinsky, the first jewish-russian poet to depict the holocaust (shoah) in the occupied soviet territories. in january 1942, while serving as a military journalist, selvinsky witnessed the immediate aftermath of the massacre of thousands of jews outside the crimean city of kerch, and thereafter composed and published poems about it. shrayer painstakingly reconstructs the details of the nazi atrocities witnessed by selvinsky, and shows that in

attention. many of its members are the children of asians who came to the united states after the immigration and nationality act of 1965 lifted long-standing restrictions on immigration. this new generation encompasses writers as diverse as the graphic novelists adrian tomine and gene luen yang, the short story writer nam le, and the poet cathy park hong. having scrutinized more than one hundred works by emerging asian american authors and having interviewed several of these writers, min hyoung song argues that collectively, these works push against existing ways of thinking about race, even as they demonstrate how race can facilitate creativity. some of the writers eschew their identification as ethnic writers, while others embrace it as a means of tackling the uncertainty that many people feel about the near future. in the literature that they create, a number of the writers that song discusses take on pressing contemporary matters such as demographic change, environmental catastrophe, and the widespread sense that the united states is in national decline. view sample pages comments from dr. song boston college libraries resources find this book in the

"http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2013summer/05hathi.html", "text": "boston college libraries newsletter - summer 2013 volume 14 number 3 summer 2013 hathitrust full text downloading now available in 2004, google made a stunning announcement: it would work with five major research libraries to digitize 15 million books within ten years. what once seemed like the stuff of futuristic dreams would become a reality, thanks to a high-tech company synonymous with internet searching. but for some, google's involvement was problematic. the print holdings of some of the world's greatest libraries were being digitized by a for-profit corporation. there was no guarantee that google would provide the same level of stewardship of the digital record that libraries have provided for their print and manuscript collections for centuries. clearly there was a need to come up with a solution that would ensure the proper management of this new and growing digital body of texts and, in 2008, a group of research libraries agreed to form hathitrust . with a membership of over 70 research institutions , hathitrust's mission is \"to contribute to the common good by collecting, organizing, preserving, communicating, and sharing the record of human knowledge.\" according to jeremy york , hathitrust project librarian, the organization's name was inspired by the hindi word for elephant or hathi (hah-tee), a wonderfully apt choice because, as york explains, the animal symbolizes great size, strength, wisdom, trustworthiness, and a reliable memory. boston college joined hathitrust in the fall of 2011, but it was only recently that the final piece, a type of login technology required by hathitrust, was put in place. members of the boston college community can now perform two actions hitherto not possible: download any hathitrust text in the public domain and create collections of hathitrust items on the hathitrust site. to log in, bc faculty, students, and staff can now go to the hathitrust home page , click on the log-in button, select boston college in the dropdown menu, click on continue, enter bc username and password, and click on sign in. as of this writing, the hathitrust digital library contains 10.7 million volumes of which 3.37 million or 31% are in the public domain. most of the content comes from the member libraries' books and serials digitized in the google and internet archive digitization projects, but it also includes items digitized by the hathitrust partners themselves. our hathitrust membership has allowed the boston college libraries to contribute 2,179 volumes so far with more to come. over four hundred languages are represented as are books from all periods of book publishing history including incunabula (books printed before 1501) like the calendarium by johannes regiomontanus (venice, 1476), a german mathematician and astronomer, and an early 1885 edition of mark twain's the adventures of huckleberry finn complete with 174 illustrations and an illustrated cover. users can find books in hathitrust by using its search interface or holmes, the boston college libraries' discovery system. if using hathitrust's search interface, you can search just its catalog or its texts (together with catalog information) . keep in mind that you will only be able to download works which are in the public domain. full text search results for works still in copyright will include page numbers where your search terms occur but downloading will not be an option (with one exception - see the next paragraph). if using holmes, begin with a search using the basic or advanced modes and then, in the refine my results column under local collections, select hathitrust digital library. it is important to keep in mind that in holmes you will be searching hathitrust's out-of-copyright texts. the 1.5 million hathitrust records in holmes are for public domain works only. if you want to search hathitrust's in-copyright texts, you will need to use the hathitrust interface. although in-copyright works cannot be downloaded, it is possible for print disabled users to gain full text access to all texts. the hathitrust website provides information about how to gain permission for eligible users to view full text copyrighted works and how to make use of its pageturner application which facilitates web page navigation. the other newly available feature, the ability to create collections of hathitrust texts on its website, offers researchers a way of enhancing access to the material they regard as the most important for their work. but it also gives them a way of laying the groundwork for textual analysis of a selected set of works. in order to facilitate textual analysis and text mining, the hathitrust research center was launched in 2011 by indiana university and the university of illinois with the purpose of providing \"a secure computational and data environment for scholars to perform research using the hathitrust digital library.\" as an exercise, i created a collection of nineteen volumes of the monumenta historica societatis iesu and called it jesuitica; it is now available to the public for searching. the hathitrust website has more information about how to get involved in this particular development of its digital library. it is safe to say that the creation of this enormous digital collection - truly a cultural \"elephant\" of information - is the beginning of a vital new chapter in the development of academic scholarship. jonas barciauskas head of collection development, o'neill library

dedicated to continuously improving their services, collections, and facilities. as part of the libraries' strategic planning initiative, a library assessment task force was created with the goal of establishing an ongoing program of usability and quality studies in order to increase the effectiveness of library services and collections in meeting user needs. libqual+ survey 2010 february 23, 2010--the boston college libraries are participating in the web-based libqual+ survey. libqual+ is a research and development project sponsored by the association of research libraries (arl) in collaboration with the texas a&m university libraries. the survey is designed to measure library users' perceptions of service quality and identify gaps between desired, perceived, and minimum expectations of service. more than 1,000 libraries participated. our participation helps us to identify where our services need improvement in the eyes of our users and to compare our service quality with that of peer institutions in an effort to develop benchmarks and understanding of best practices across institutions. an e-mail invitation to participate in the libqual+ survey (see link above) was e-mailed by university librarian tom wall to all current boston college faculty, students, and staff on feb. 18. libqual+ results 2010 boston college faculty boston college graduate students

orbis books, 2013 kenneth r. himes , associate professor, theology department beyond electoral campaigns and government structures, the relationship between the political realm and christianity has always involved the important questions of how we ought to live together, and how we should organize and govern our common life. himes notes that politics - and the political choices we make - must be \"guided by considerations of national and global justice and peace and, for christians, by the teachings of jesus,\" as interpreted by tradition. himes examines the relationship between christianity and politics from the teachings of the old and new testaments through the patristic and medieval eras and the age of reform to the age of revolution, and through the twentieth century into the third millennium. he addresses questions of the role of the church in politics, responsible voting, concerns of globalization, and issues of human rights and war and peace. view sample pages comments from

channel surfing and happened to catch certain scenes of street fight boogie man: the lee atwater story (dir. stefan forbes, 2008, 86 mins) e840.8 .a89 b66 2008 if he was in your corner it'd be hard not to be thankful everyday for the cunning, energy, insight, and naked ruthlessness of lee atwater. the man won elections. if however your political campaign fell victim to his legendary bare-knuckle (some might say downright evil) tactics you'd probably have moments when you questioned if he was some minor agent of the prince of darkness. is that hyperbole? yes. but atwater\u2014political strategist extraordinaire, mentor to karl rove, and architect of george h.w. bush's 1988 presidential victory\u2014was a man who delighted in hyperbole, theatrics, fact-bending, and downright fabrication so long as they led to victory for whichever republican candidate he supported at the moment. the man was very good at his job. rising from the south carolina student republican scene, gaining experience under sen. strom thurmond, and maturing in the reagan white house, atwater understood very early on that \"perception is reality\" and that people tend to vote from their fears rather than their hopes\u2026if only someone can show them the way. few in modern politics have been more effective in this regard than he. this film is very interesting in that, while fully acknowledging the self-evidently underhanded tactics that atwater so gleefully employed to win elections, it gives significant screen time to friends and colleagues who, on a personal level, remember him as a kind, funny, and vivacious lover (and player) of blues music, an image in stark contrast to the savage political operator that was apparent to his foes. featuring many of the major players in u.s. national politics over the last 30 years this film repeatedly makes clear an unfortunate truth about the electoral process: it is rarely the \"best\" or most noble candidate who wins, but rather the one who possesses the will to do that which their opponent won't in order to get votes. a fascinating and sobering watch. point of order! (dir. emile de antonio, 1964, 97 mins) e743.5 .p656 2005 so much has been written and said about sen. joseph mccarthy, his mendacious efforts to root out supposed communist subversion in the u.s. government during the 1950s, and his eventual downfall that it's especially rewarding to watch point of order! a film in which no commentary whatsoever is offered at all. it is simply a document (though very selectively edited) of the televised 1954 army-mccarthy hearings during which the entire nation was finally able to see for themselves the shallow and vicious nature of mccarthy's campaign. we watch what the home viewing audience watched decades ago: altered photographs, forged correspondence, the bullying of witnesses, and mccarthy's total inability to respond in any meaningful way when asked to provide actual proof of his bombastic claims. on paper, 50-year-old footage from a 6-week long senate hearing doesn't sound quite like captivating programming; but given the historical import, preponderance of colorful characters (both for the prosecution and defense), and the superb editing this film is among the most interesting political documentaries that you're likely to find. even if you come into it with no awareness of historical context you'll be able to follow along with the hearing's proceedings as the affable but wily joseph welch (counsel for the army) goes toe-to-toe and steadily disarms the mccarthy and his formidable counsel roy cohn. the kennedys: america's emerald kings (dir. robert kline, 2008, 128 mins) e843 .m35 2008 if the kennedy's are, as they're often described, \"american royalty\" this film serves as a reasonably thorough court register of the clan's origins, rise, struggles, achievements, and modern-day legacy. a reverent but never fawning chronicle that begins with the immigration of patrick kennedy (great-grandfather to the president) from ireland to boston, this film details his and his descendants' triumph of over vicious anti-irish sentiment in 19th century massachusetts, the family's steady acquisition of fortune and political clout, the conquest of the presidency and the multiple well-known tragedies that shadowed the dynasty throughout. giving the lion's share of its running time, unsurprisingly, to jfk and his uphill climb to become the nation's first and only catholic president, the kennedys also includes an emotional segment about his sometimes aloof, but also inspiring, brother robert. hearing the audio of senate icon ted kennedy's eulogy of rfk over a freeze-framed image of him is a moment you are not likely to forget both for its sorrow and hope. the film ends with a worthwhile, if sometimes tedious recap of ted's legislative legacy and brief looks at the public service achievements of other family members such as eunice kennedy shriver and caroline kennedy schlossberg. as its title suggests, the thread holding the film together is the family's firm sense of their irish heritage and what it meant to them through the generations. this is superbly displayed in the footage of jfk and ted kennedy's separate state visits to the emerald isle decades apart, and the wildly enthusiastic receptions they both received while reminiscing about the homelands importance to the family. lake of fire (dir. tony kaye, 2006, 152 mins) hq767 .l354 2007 i really can't imagine a film that could be more comprehensive in dealing with the most divisive \"wedge\" issue in american politics over the last 40 years. it doesn't matter if you consider yourself \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice\" (terms themselves that are charged and rather questionable) lake of fire will include views that you both heartily agree with and vehemently oppose. filmed in a dispassionate matter-of-fact style using high-contrast black & white photography this movie includes interviews with politicians, clergy, abortion doctors, women who've terminated their pregnancies, and committed activists on both sides of the issue (both radical and mainstream). it does not seek to sway in either direction, only to document, and with a length of 2.5 hours you have plenty of time to think over whatever notions you may have about the issue in light of the incredible stories and testimonies you're witnessing. if only ever marquee political issue in the us had such an evenhanded and thorough film to accompany it, voters might come to see that some things are too complex to fall within the scope of media-tethered electoral politics. and yes, this movie is extremely thorough and as such, not for everyone. it contains very graphic medical footage dealing with abortion that isn't used bombastically or in the service of an agenda, but is rather necessarily included in order to give the viewer the knowledge necessary to adequately consider the issue being portrayed. if you feel that abortion seriously matters to you, whether on a political, moral or emotional level, this is a film that you cannot afford to miss. advise and consent (dir. otto preminger, 1962, 139 mins) ps3554 .r8 a3 2005 the nomination and senate confirmation, or rejection, of a presidential appointee to the cabinet or judiciary is an american political ritual that can either pass utterly unnoticed (quick! name the current secretary of agriculture\u2026didn't think so\u2026) or be subject to incredible debate and scrutiny. if the president's party happens to control the senate things generally go smoothly, but even that is no guarantee. senators, serving for six years and wielding considerable individual power, do not tend to just fall in line and back a white house pick simply because they and the president share the same parenthetical letter after their name in a c-span chyron. if the upper chamber happens to belong to the opposition party then the president and nominee had better be ready for a thorough and sometimes nasty vetting process. in advise and consent (named from the constitutional clause granting the senate this review process) things get testy very quickly when the second-term president, in a surprise move, nominates robert leffingwell (henry fonda) for the office of secretary of state. his party holds the majority but there are many among them who doubt the candidate and soon a witness is brought in alleging his past involvement in a communist cell. he denies the charge, but things are more than they seem and from there we're treated to a superbly written and directed film examining pride, intrigue, loyalty, blackmail and backstabbing in the atmosphere of early 1960s washington. lurid for its time, this movie certainly doesn't offer a saintly depiction of washington politics, but it has heart and shows that some men act nobly out of duty and some act dishonorably for the same reason. one of the many delights of the film are the extended sequences where the senators debate, criticize, flatter, attack and joke amongst themselves on the senate floor while using almost poetic language and adhering to robert's rule's of order. some of the best crowd dialogue i've ever seen in a movie. the fog of war: eleven lessons from the life of robert s. (dir. errorl morris, 2003, 95 mins) e840.4 .f68 2004 it's an interesting cinematic experience to have a former secretary of state, look directly at you and confess that he was wrong for helping to engineer the deaths of 100,000 people in a single night many decades ago. and that's just one moment from the fog of war , a movie so packed with hard-earned insights, revelations, and unanswerable questions that i doubt anyone would object to multiple viewings - just to soak it all in. the film's subject is robert s. mcnamara, a man who was president of both ford motor co. and the world bank. between those two gigs he was the longest serving secretary of defense in history, working for both jfk and lbj between 1961 and 1968. he had a huge hand in shaping the entry of the u.s. into the vietnam conflict, and then severely escalating its involvement. he remains a divisive figure to say the least. whatever feelings you may have about him you can't deny the degree to which he holds the viewer's interest as he speaks about his life, the lessons he learned in business, and the hard world-affecting decisions he made while in office. directed by the legendary documentarian errol morris using his \"interrotron\" camera rig that allows interviewer & interviewee to look into each other's eyes while simultaneously looking directly into the camera (and thus allows mcnamara to seem to stare into our own eyes) this movie is structured as a sort of geo-political primer, offering segments with such titles as: rationality will not save us and you can't change human nature . mcnamara (85 when filmed) comes off as a thoughtful and alert man who isn't here to save face or self-aggrandize. he displays a surprising amount of honesty and self-awareness, and while he maintains many of his convictions decades later, he also questions much of his past, such as his role in planning the tokyo firebombing of march 1945 that killed one hundred thousand. this is a riveting display of how one man, never elected to public office, can shape so much of the political destiny of a democracy such as the united states. wes hazard , media services assistant, o'neill library bc libraries home |

information systems (gis) by barbara mento if you've been following the upcoming elections, you've probably seen the red and blue maps for the 2012 elections. this is a great example of how gis-- a powerful and fun tool for the visualization of any data having a geographic component--is used to analyze trends and patterns. in fact, boston college has used gis to track geographic distribution of bc students since 1976 (see geographic distribution of undergraduate students by state 2010 ). bc has a license for arcgis software which supports sophisticated mapping and analysis of data from demographics, history, public health, sociology, environmental issues, and most other fields of study. an interesting example of its use is the 2010 project of then undergraduate kevin keegan to map tree species on campus in order to evaluate the ways in which trees offset the university\u2019s carbon footprint (see boston college magazine article with an illustration by kevin keegan: chestnut hill campus, with colors denoting species of trees ). the boston college libraries will be celebrating gis day, november 14, 2012 in addition to hosting the fourth annual gis contest in spring 2013. note that undergraduate kevin keegan was our first winner in 2010! see his entry here . prizes include amazon gift certificates. to learn more about gis day and the gis contest, please contact barbara mento , data/gis librarian. if you are interested in learning more, introductory workshops on gis are offered every semester, co-taught by barbara mento, data/gis librarian and constantin andronache, senior research associate, its research services. barbara mento , manager, virtual data center, o'neill library bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Analyze

been working at bapst library since the beginning of my freshman year. i remember when i toured boston college, my tour guide mentioned to me that it was when she walked into gargan hall for the first time that she decided to come to bc. growing up in chestnut hill, bc was practically my backyard. so by the time i was visiting colleges, i already had my heart set on going to bc. when i saw bapst for the first time on that tour, though, i knew i had to work there. photo by kevin tringale i am a sophomore in csom concentrating in finance and double majoring in philosophy. the reason i am doing the philosophy major is because of the perspectives class that i took with professor kerry cronin whose office is actually located in bapst. it is nice seeing kerry at work and getting to catch up, since she often comes in and out of her office at the lonergan institute, located next to gargan hall. i am so thankful i got the job as a circulation desk assistant here at bapst. it is so great to work at a library, especially at one like bapst, because i am constantly around very studious and dedicated students and it inspires me to work even harder. also, the staff at bapst are some of the nicest people at bc. it's so wonderful coming to work every week and getting to work with such great role-models. we have a very close-knit staff at bapst and that makes for a greatly collaborative working environment. my shifts at bapst consist of shelving, shelf-reading (managing my section of the art stacks), helping patrons check out books, and giving people directions to the bathroom (my most common task). working at bapst has also given me a new appreciation for art. since bapst houses almost all of the art books and collections at bc, i mostly work with architecture, painting, sculpture, drawing, and photography books during my shifts and, as a result, i've learned a lot more about these forms of art. as for my other involvements, there are three organizations i have been a part of since my freshman year. one is the student admission program (sap), for which i give tours, sit on information panels, host day visits, and greet prospective students in devlin hall. i was lucky enough to be part of the sap summer staff this past summer, which gave me a greater appreciation for the work of the bc admission counselors and sap, in general. i also am the prospective student outreach coordinator for the bc hillel, our jewish student organization. i especially look forward to our weekly friday night home-cooked shabbat dinners. finally, i am part of the appalachia volunteers (aka appa). i recently went on a trip with appa to help build a home with habitat for humanity in exmore, virginia. appa was a really rewarding experience that i recommend doing before graduation! i have absolutely loved my first year at bapst and i am looking forward to my next three, working at my favorite place on campus! alan lipchin, csom in finance & philosophy \u201815 bc

the strategic planning process with five goals and a number of key strategies for achieving them. in june 2010 an implementation plan was introduced for the 2010-11 academic year with 17 action items in strategic areas drawn from the summary document. we begin year two of the strategic plan with this overview of what has been achieved in these areas. in addition to the action items, this report highlights other accomplishments from the past year that contributed to the goals laid out last spring. staff from all departments of the libraries contributed to these accomplishments, helping move the libraries forward and laying the groundwork for continued progress in the years ahead. the next step is to develop priorities for the coming year. the strategic vision council will examine what was left undone or incomplete from last year\u2019s plan. we will also look at changing circumstances and emerging needs to develop a new set of goals and key strategies. the innovative operations council will then be asked to develop an implementation plan with action items for the 2011-2012 academic year. staff throughout the libraries will have an opportunity to provide input throughout this process and will, of course, be key in the achievement of these new goals and action items. summary document update the summary document laid out five areas with goals and strategies for each: information resources & collections; special collections & scholarly communication; service & content delivery; engagement, partnerships & community building; and organizational culture. information resources & collections goals and strategies in the area of information resources & collections focused on reconfiguring our collections in a changing environment to provide more digital content; improved organization and access to all collections; and flexible policies and procedures for an uncertain and rapidly evolving environment. during the past year the libraries expanded digital content with growing collections of e-books, streaming media, e-journal backfiles, and open content from hathi trust and other sources via holmes. material in offsite facilities was assessed and reorganized to provide easier discovery and retrieval. a patron driven acquisition project was launched with ebrary, along with other efforts to study new ways of managing collection development in the growing area of electronic books. preliminary research was done on development of core print collections at other institutions with the long term aim of freeing up for new uses space currently used for print resources. staff gathered input from faculty and other users that helped drive allocation decisions in retrospective monograph acquisition, end-of-year \u201cbig item\u201d purchases, and application of strategic funds from the provost\u2019s office. see information resources & collections in the appendix for the complete list of goals, strategies, and accomplishments in this area. special collections & scholarly communication goals and strategies in the area of special collections & scholarly communication focused on converting unique holdings of burns library to digital format; collecting, preserving, and providing access to faculty research and key university documents; and providing e-publishing and digital scholarship leadership and expertise to the campus. new positions of scholarly communication librarian and associate university librarian for special collections were created in the past year. a digital program planning group was formed with several task forces focused on identifying items for digitization, setting policies and procedures, and increasing awareness of digitized content of value to bc faculty and students and the broader academic community. the number of digital objects hosted in the libraries\u2019 digitool program increased 163% and now includes graduate and undergraduate honors theses, faculty and administrative staff publications, boston college histories, and library special collections. more than 400 books from the libraries were digitized as part of the boston library consortium-sponsored open content alliance scanning center. faculty were surveyed regarding their publication practices and e-scholarship service needs with follow-ups scheduled with faculty interested in making their research available via escholarship @ bc, the libraries\u2019 institutional repository. see collections and scholarly communication in the appendix for the complete list of goals, strategies, and accomplishments in this area. service & content delivery goals and strategies in the area of service & content delivery focused on expanded use of virtual and mobile services, consolidation of physical service points, development of new delivery options, revamping of the libraries website, and integration of library services and content into campus learning environments. a new version of the libraries mobile site was launched in the spring with connections to library hours, mobile research services, and the ability to renew loans, book study rooms, view course reserves, and get help. course reserve access was also integrated into blackboard vista. hours for text and chat references services were expanded with use of text more than doubling over the previous year. a new streamlined libraries home page was launched with a direct search link into holmes. new online subject portals and more than 20 new course-specific research guides were added. o\u2019neill circulation and course reserves were consolidated into a single service point with a self checkout machine nearby. testing and preliminary launch of the worldcat local service was completed for improved resource sharing with other boston library consortium institutions. delivery services among the chestnut hill, brighton, and newton campuses were expanded to all faculty and graduate students. an enhanced instruction group was established and began work on new ways of integrating library instruction into the university curriculum. see service & content delivery in the appendix for the complete list of goals, strategies, and accomplishments in this area. engagement, partnership & community building goals and strategies in the area of engagement, partnership & community building focused partnerships with other campus entities to develop new and enhanced services and spaces, engaging with faculty around areas of mutual interest, and creating robust and vibrant marketing/communication and events programs. ongoing meetings with graduate and undergraduate student groups and online polling led to several changes, including: expansion of graduate study space with new furniture; addition of new scanning stations; adjustment of technology loan periods; and development of a library technology support center. collaboration with instructional design and eteaching services led to intergration of course reserve content into blackboard vista. the library is also developing tools to allow faculty to search for library media materials from within blackboard and to request digitization services for materials of interest. linkable image slideshows promoting library resources were added to the website. new and renovated spaces in the libraries include: the addition of study booths and vending machines on level 1 of o\u2019neill; art galleries of on levels 1 and 3 of o\u2019neill; and collaborative space in the educational resource center. libraries staff advised and assisted omc staff on the bc proud refrain project which will be a web-based, multimedia collection of contemporary accounts and alumni recollections of life at bc through the years. see engagement, partnership & community building in the appendix for the complete list of goals, strategies, and accomplishments in this area. organizational culture goals and strategies in the area of organizational culture focused on flexible and adaptable structures, continued development of a learning organization, shared leadership, innovation at all levels, transparency, and a culture of assessment. the advisory group on the learning organization was formed in the summer of 2010 and formed several task groups. the internal communication task group established an electronic bulletin board and other internal communication mechanisms. the committee inventory task group created an inventory of library groups and committees. the discussion forums task group initiated monthly staff coffee hours with the university librarian and began planning a program of guest speakers on organizational culture. the climate assessment task group began preparation for fall implementation of climatequal, the association of research libraries\u2019 survey tool for assessment of library staff perceptions concerning the library's commitment to the principles of diversity, organizational policies and procedures, and staff attitudes. see organizational culture in the appendix for the complete list of goals, strategies, and accomplishments in this area. appendix: goals, strategies, and accomplishments information resources & collections goal: the boston college libraries excel at providing information resources and collections that support and inspire outstanding teaching, innovative research, and a culture of intellectual curiosity. key strategies: develop and implement collection-building strategies, policies, and procedures that are more agile and responsive to demonstrated user interests and needs

ask a librarian 24/7 research guides looking back\u2014way back\u2014at spring break the origins of a collegiate rite of spring you may have been away from scholarly pursuits on spring break, but that doesn\u2019t mean the scholars weren\u2019t pursuing you . we\u2019ll spare you the scholarly details here \u2013 consider it a little extension of the break. instead, let\u2019s see what research resources available from the bc libraries reveal about how the spring break phenomenon got started in the first place. it began when swim coach sam ingram of colgate university in upstate new york brought his team to fort lauderdale to swim at the beachfront casino pool \u2013 the first olympic-sized pool in the state of florida. ingram and local officials then organized an annual aquatic forum (later known as the college swim forum). 45, 321 # of books currently checked out of o'neill library 172,666 hits a year most used library database: psycinfo 10,000 a year number of plastic bags given to students men vs. women pew internet & american life project report - view current exhibits - apply for a summer job - take home videos and dvds from the media center by 1938, more than 300 swimmers were competing at the event \u2013 and spreading the word about fort lauderdale as a fun-in-the-sun escape from the cold weather further north. by the 1950s, an estimated 20,000 students were heading to florida each year on spring break. the growing phenomenon drew national attention: time magazine first highlighted spring break in an april 1959 article called \u201cbeer & the beach\u201d and january 1961 saw the release of the spring break-themed hit film \u201cwhere the boys are,\u201d set in fort lauderdale and starring (among others) a young george hamilton. (maybe that\u2019s where he started working on that famous tan.) fort lauderdale remained the number one destination for spring breakers well into the 1980s. it peaked in 1985 \u2013 two years after the release of \u201cspring break,\u201d another movie set there \u2013 when 350,000 revelers descended on the florida city. but by the end of the \u201880s, fort lauderdale had had enough: stricter laws against public drinking were enacted and enforced; mayor bob cox went on good morning america to tell students they were no longer welcome; marketers focused on an older demographic; and by 1992 student visitors were back down to 20-30,000 a year. and what about the casino pool in fort lauderdale, the place where spring break was born? torn down in 1966, the site is host today to history of another sort as the home of the international swimming hall of fame. tracing the history of spring break in the bc libraries the following library sources and services were used in compiling information used in this article: lexisnexis academic , factiva , and the new york times (1851 - 2002) for newspaper articles about spring break; expanded academic asap for magazine articles; business source premier for a look at the business side of spring break; o\u2019neill microfilm for the 1959 time magazine article \u201cbeer & the beach\u201d; psycinfo , sociological abstracts , eric , and other databases for scholarly research on spring break; interlibrary loan for a key article, \u201cspring break student travel \u2013 an exploratory study\u201d in the journal of travel & tourism marketing ; and, yes, google, for good information on the web sites of the city of fort lauderdale; the international swimming hall of fame; the college swimming coaches association of america; and others. by kenneth liss subject specialist for communication and history o\u2019neill library reference bc libraries home libweb@bc.edu | ugrads@bc.library editorial board", "hrefTitle": "Spring

floor entrance is a collection of books that we are currently calling the popular reading collection. it is a rental collection of bestsellers, mysteries, romance novels, biographies, graphic novels, humor, self-help, and popular nonfiction. the collection was the idea of the student library advisory group and fills the need that some students have to be able to browse current popular books unrelated to class work and their wish to be able to curl up with a good book to take their mind off of their academic responsibilities. like listening to music or watching a video. there are approximately 300 books in the collection and each month new titles will be added and those that have not circulated will be sent back to the vendor. the books can be checked out for 28 days \ufffd other information about checking the books out is located in the level 1 display. popular reading shelf photo by kevin tringale so far the six books that have been checked out the most include that

fall 2010 thrills & chills horror film recommendations available for check out in o'neill media center by wes hazard night of the creeps (dir. fred dekker, 1986, 88 minutes) pn1997 .n544864 2009 \"the good news is your dates are here. the bad news is... they're dead.\" such is the famous tagline (and actual line of dialogue) from the mid 80s genre-bending cult classic night of the creeps . this movie has it all: rubber suited aliens, axe murderers, zombie frat boys, completely unsubtle anatomical symbolism, a weaponized lawnmower--i mean seriously, you'll want for nothing. funny, self-aware and with some 80s period flourishes that you'll forever appreciate, night of the creeps is one of those movies that you can laugh both at and with every step of the way. and it's got heart too; try not to tear up a little when you listen to the cassette tape farewell message. with one of the best first dates that i can remember in the movies (boy and girl teaming up with a shotgun and a flamethrower while in formal wear) this pic has a little something for everyone. bram stoker's dracula (dir. francis ford coppola, 1992, 128 minutes) pr6037.t617 d73 1997 granted, two hours of listening to keanu reeves do his best british accent might not sound like the greatest of movie experiences, but if you can get over it you'll find one of the most sensual and audacious of mainstream vampire movies ever made. forget the godfather , this is hands down my favorite francis ford coppola movie. as he's the 2nd most filmed fictional character of all time (after sherlock holmes) most people think they've already \"been there\" when it comes to count d. but by sticking closely to the original novel and playing up the victorian era repression and emergence into modernity this movie really manages to be something singular. absolutely fantastic special effects, a riveting score, and ridiculous performances by rocker tom waits as the madman renfield and gary oldman as the count make this a minor masterpiece of early 90s horror. you won't soon forget images like a severely decrepit oldman licking a bloody razor blade or a hulking bat-demon morphing into a mound of rats before your eyes. great stuff. an american werewolf in london (dir. john landis, 1981, 97 minutes) pn1997 .a44 2001 so you know the thriller video? this is its awesome and multi-talented director (john landis) let loose on a script he wrote for a feature length black comedy werewolf classic. morbid and witty humor, an authentic moral dilemma, and perhaps the best man to wolf transformation scene in all of cinema. this only gets better each year. n.b. there was a prodigiously inferior quasi-sequel made sixteen years later with the dude from dead man on campus and that thing you do and set in paris--it's probably best you don't watch it. zombieland (dir. ruben fleischer, 2009, 88 minutes) pn1997.2 .z663 2010 before he was mark zuckerberg, founder of facebook, jesse eisenberg played columbus, a paranoid neurotic survivor of the zombie apocalypse who gets by because he sticks to his own basic rules. you know, simple things, like maintain good cardio and always give a zombie two taps with the shotgun. with strong supporting performances by woody harrelson, emma stone and abigail breslin ( little miss sunshine all grown up) this movie manages to spice up the well-worn zombie genre by not taking itself too seriously and focusing on the relationships of necessity and co-dependence that naturally form when 95% of the country starts craving brains. it's also damn funny. bill murray, playing himself, gets my vote for cameo of the decade. calvaire (dir. fabrice du welz, 2004, 88 minutes) pn1993.5 .b4 c35 2004 psycho meets deliverance meets the texas chainsaw massacre ... in french. calvaire ( the ordeal ) follows a few days in the life of marc, a likeable and considerate but not particularly talented or lucky belgian lounge singer. he does his annual holiday gig at a country retirement home, deflects the super awkward and direct advances of a woman old enough to be his grandmother, has his van break down on a desolate road and then gets taken in by an extremely unstable inn-keeper pining for his deceased wife. things then get worse, a whole lot worse. this movie pretty much answers the question \"what are the most horrible things that can happen to you if you're stuck in the remote belgian wilderness with insane farmhands who know their way around an axe, have an abundance of old dresses lying around, and really , really enjoy the company of pigs?\" it's bad news all around. a bloody and depraved european treat. dead again (dir. kenneth branagh, 1991, 107 minutes) pn1997 .d423 2006 ok, so this isn't so much of a horror movie as it is a supernatural thriller/romance, but it has murder, mystery, reincarnation and that awesome title going for it so why not? kenneth branagh, known mainly as the best shakespeare interpreter of the last two decades and as prof. gilderoy lockhart from the second harry potter movie, directs and stars in this offbeat pic about an la private eye trying to sort out the identity of a mute woman who shows up one night at the orphanage he grew up in. one thing leads to another and soon enough they're not only in love but also suspecting that they share a spiritual link with a famous composer and his murdered wife from forty years before. think of it as a more expressionistic and heartfelt version of the thirteenth floor ... but with a creepy hypnotist thrown in. guest spots include a touching monologue from wayne knight (newman of seinfeld ) and a fantastic turn by robin williams as a disgraced psychiatrist working as a supermarket stock boy. a one of a kind overlooked gem. vampire hunter d. bloodlust (dir. yoshiaki kawajiri, 2000, 103 minutes) pn1993.5.j3 v36 2001 for all you anime fans. back in 1985 vampire hunter d managed to become one of the first pieces of feature length japanese animation to break through in america. while i appreciate that film i just don't think it can compare to this sequel from 2000. adapting a later book from hideyuki kikuchi's series of vampire novels, this movie benefits from superior animation and music as well as more interesting and well-drawn characters. thousands of years in the future, where androids and mutants are just part of life, vampires rule the night. they terrorize the village-folk, wilt the vegetation, kidnap young maidens and basically kick up ruckus on a regular basis. enter d, a half human half vampire bounty hunter with a six-foot sword and a sarcastic yet cowardly talking left hand. need i go on? crazy visuals and an interesting examination of the nature and limits of love make this a thoroughly solid and rewarding film. trick 'r treat (dir. michael dougherty, 2007, 82 minutes) pn1997.2 .t75 2009 it's a crime that movie studio politics kept this film out of theaters, but even with a straight to dvd release it's managed to find a bit of a cult following, and rightfully so. at times scary, funny, political and just plain weird, the story follows intersecting groups of people (some of them predators... some of them prey... some both) during a halloween night in small-town america. we're introduced to a school principal pursuing some super-felonious extracurricular activities, a pack of fun-loving sorority girls who are more than they appear to be, naive teenagers who take a local legend way too far, and this little troll-like character with a burlap sack on his head who shows up whenever trouble's afoot. you'll like it for its inventive screenplay, you'll love it because a dude gets dispatched with a jagged lollipop. enough said. *for more horror film reviews see \" be

issue: 150th | mobile library | pete | films | self service | popular reading fall 2010 meet pete by pete toporzycki for the past four years, i have worked on the second floor of o'neill library in the end processing center. the center is a little hole in the wall located in the technical services department across from the media center. i am mainly responsible for processing every book that goes to all of the boston college libraries. pete toporzycki photo by kevin tringale after working in end processing my entire freshman year (12 hours per week), i decided to return for the next two summers. working during the summers at o'neill library certainly helped me adjust to the feeling of a 9 to 5 job along with providing me with a sense of responsibility. i have been introduced to a wonderful group of people and great experiences that have shaped my boston college career for the better. what is end processing? enough about me; let's get down to what exactly goes on in end processing. simply put end processing is a vital part of the boston college libraries. whenever o'neill, bapst, burns, social work, and theology & ministry orders new books, they are delivered to the second floor of o'neill for cataloging. after that has been completed we use a library database called aleph to assign and link a boston college barcode and call number to each book. next, the books are prepared for their respective libraries. in preparing books for their respective libraries, we have to stamp, strip and label each book. we stamp the books according to their library location, place security strips inside the books to discourage theft, and then iron on the call numbers. of these three tasks, my favorite would have to be ironing on the labels. in fact, freshman year, i was given the distinguished honor of \"labeler of the year.\" on a different note, perhaps my least favorite job is working with the weston observatory books and in room 150. room 150, also known to some as \"the dungeon\", is a dark, desolate storage facility where thousands of old and dusty books are kept while awaiting processing. the books are quite interesting, as they date back centuries, but the lack of windows in room 150 gives it a gloomy feeling. it is all part of the job, however, that needs to be done to provide more resources to the students of boston college. none of these resources would be available if it was not for the entire end processing team. the staff frances bates is the head of the book lab which focuses on restoring damaged books. you would be amazed at how many library books are casualties of spilled coffee or mishandling, and frances does a tremendous job of repairing them for re-circulation. she also takes periodicals and journals that the library subscribes to and binds them together in hardcover. if you are ever doing a research project, be sure to check out the bound periodicals by subject throughout the library. before continuing on, i don't want to leave anyone out, so i would just like to give a shout out to the entire end processing team. personally, i would like to thank megan ritter (who was a senior when i was a freshman) for taking me under her wing and showing me the ropes of end processing. there are so many people, in so many locations that work to provide thousands of resources to all of the students. you may play a sport or have a class with someone that works in the library. next time you see them, be sure to thank them. for here all are one pete toporzycki , accounting, csom, '11 cover photo by kevin tringale

from the boston college libraries ugrads @ bc.library this issue: answers | ebooks | bridget | meet jackie | documentaries | what's happening discovering documentaries reviews from the o\u2019neill media center collection by wes hazard marwencol (jeff malmberg, 2010, 84 minutes) o\u2019neill media center rc387.5 .m375 2010 sometimes art imitates life, often life imitates art, and sometimes mere imitation is done away with completely and you\u2019re left observing someone whose entire existence, the very way they approach the world, might reasonably be confused with a grand-scale art project. mark hogancamp is one of those people. years ago mark was a divorced and self-destructive alcoholic with an obvious talent for art. one night, for reasons that are only gradually revealed, he was brutally attacked outside of a bar by five men who beat him so badly that he lost most of his memory and motor control. out of a coma, and with his health insurance benefits rapidly drying up, mark was forced to develop his own therapies to assist him in becoming himself again. he created marwencol , a scale model of a wwii era belgian town populated by g.i. joes and barbie dolls (some representing made-up characters, other standing in for mark\u2019s friends and acquaintances) that is as expansive as it is intricately detailed. with stunning commitment and imagination mark creates continuously evolving storylines where nazi goons, belgian witches, american pows, mark\u2019s co-workers and mark himself battle each other, relax at the neutral saloon, travel through time, and play out the scenes of hogancamp\u2019s subconscious, all in 1/6 scale. when the copious photographs that mark takes of these scenes find their way to the editor of a magazine dedicated to outsider art mark is hailed as an artistic revelation and invited to star in a new york gallery show. the tension between exhibiting his art in the very world that he escapes from by creating it is palpable and only enhanced by certain details of mark\u2019s personality that slowly come to the surface over the course of the film. throughout this movie you can\u2019t help but wonder what marwencol actually represents. is it a tool for mark to cope with what\u2019s happened to him or is it an escape created so that he doesn\u2019t have to face the reality of his new life? is it art? can it survive being shown to the world? the film doesn\u2019t answer these questions, but you\u2019ll definitely be glad that it asks them. the case of howard phillips lovecraft (1998, 65 minutes) o\u2019neill media center ps3523 .o833 z57 2007 documentaries usually succeed or fail based on how well they can tell a story and how interesting their subjects are. much less often do you find one that\u2019s captivating because of its style and direction. this is one of those\u2026though it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that it profiles the author of some of the most original and twisted horror fiction of all time. if you\u2019re not an enthusiast of the genre it\u2019s very possible that you\u2019ve never heard of hp lovecraft, much less read one of his stories. no matter. this movie is so good at presenting the tone and spirit of his works that it renders any other introduction unnecessary. that\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t want to explore lovecraft\u2019s fiction after watching (you will), it just means that this documentary is brilliant as a stand-alone piece. it solves the most fundamental problem of a documentary such as this admirably well: how do you make a film, a piece of visual art, about a man who lived almost entirely inside of his head? it does so rather inventively by using a combination of stock footage (early 20th century street scenes, microscope clips of cell division and bacteria, grainy medical school training films, etc) and original material recorded in what looks like an old haunted mansion and featuring a cardboard cutout of the author on wheels that you will not soon forget after viewing. all of this is narrated over by a measured yet incantatory voice reading bits of lovecraft stories and correspondence as well as addressing the author in the second person like some sort of disembodied judge. if you ever feel like watching an hour of inventive film collage about a master of horror you can do a lot worse than beginning here. grizzly man (werner herzog, 2005, 104 minutes) o\u2019neill media center ql737 .c27 g75 2005 for thirteen summers timothy treadway lost himself in the alaskan wilderness while following, filming, and mingling with grizzly bears \u2013 the animals he came to love and revere far more than anything else in the world. he knew their movements and habits. he came up with whimsical names ( mr. chocolate, aunt elizabeth, freckles, quincy, etc) for every individual bear he met. he was able to familiarize the grizzlies with his presence enough to get shockingly close to them on a regular basis. still, at least in the footage we see, he never seems to forget how dangerous they really are and the cautions one must take when around them. these cautions were ultimately not enough because in his thirteenth summer treadway, along with a companion, was killed and eaten by a grizzly. this is made clear about eight minutes into the movie, the following hour and half is an exploration (via the hundreds of hours of footage that treadway left behind and interviews with friends and nature experts) of just how it was that a solitary man could come to identify so closely with bears that he would, as is evident, wish to become one, to abandon the human world and live as one with his favorite beings. treadway is a model subject for a documentary. he had an extremely off-kilter but endearing personality, he was a prodigious self-filmmaker who loved to talk out loud when alone, and he had a passion for getting up close and personal with some of the most efficient killing machines to ever walk the earth. it would probably be riveting enough to watch a stand-alone edited version of his personal footage, but with master director werner herzog directing this movie, conducting interviews, probing into treadway\u2019s psyche and laying down his inimitable voiceover on top of everything you get one of the most intense documentary character studies ever put to film. a modern classic and a total gem. the mindscape of alan moore (dez vylenz, 2008, 78 minutes) o\u2019neill media center pn6737 .m66 m56 2008 there aren\u2019t very many living people who, by general acclamation, are regarded as the absolute best in the history of their field. the nature of a title like that tends to favor the giants of the past. thus no matter how many undisputed masterpieces a modern writer might produce, they\u2019d always find it impossible to step out of shakespeare\u2019s shadow. nowadays a genius requires a relatively new field of endeavor if they are to be thought of in that way. michael jordan and wayne gretzky come to mind, as does alan moore. no creative force in comic books (writer or artist) is as lauded by his peers, respected by his fans, or known more widely to the general public than the long haired shaman from the north of england who created watchmen and v for vendetta among many other classics. if none of that means anything to you then the mindscape of alan moore might not be the best film for you to see. unlike an artist character study which attempts to peel away layers of the subject\u2019s public persona in order to get a raw look at them, this documentary is basically 80 minutes of moore talking directly to the camera (with no interviewer input) spliced with images from his graphic novels and other assorted footage. that\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t interesting (quite the contrary) but it\u2019s very clear that this movie goes only where moore wants it to go and presents only the finely crafted image of himself that he wishes to present. you don\u2019t necessarily have to be a fan of moore, or even of comics, to appreciate this piece; but you do have to be willing to listen to the personal history, philosophical musings, and freely dispensed invective of a sixty year old, self-described magician with a penchant for the paranormal and full-finger rings. it\u2019s certainly not for everybody but this doc goes to some pretty interesting places (fascism, the relationship between art and magic, alternate universes, morphogenesis, etc.) while still giving you the dirt on why moore hates the very idea of a watchmen film so much. on oddball film, but worth it. for all mankind (al reinert, 1989, 80 minutes) o\u2019neill media center tl789.8 .u6 f67 2009 uplifting is an adjective that gets tossed around almost reflexively whenever a documentary about human accomplishment is being discussed. sometimes it\u2019s earned, sometimes not. for all mankind not only earns it, it might just make the word more meaningful for you. a triumph of editing, this film, in 80 minutes, masterfully compresses the ten years\u2014beginning with jfk\u2019s 1962 speech at rice university and ending with the last apollo mission in 1972\u2014during which america embarked on one of the greatest scientific and engineering endeavors in human history: to land men on the moon and return them safely to earth. the earthbound footage is captivating on its own. it might be hard to imagine how a room full of 100 tie-wearing engineers looking at computer monitors might hold your interest, but with excellent cutting and pacing it\u2019s a joy to watch the close-ups on their tense faces in the moments during countdown or their unrestrained joy when armstrong and aldrin\u2019s lunar module successfully lands. watching the astronauts, in full gear, trying to relax on la-z-boy recliners before getting into the cockpit is the kind of incongruous image that you won\u2019t soon forget. but it\u2019s when the movie takes us into space that its true grandeur emerges. powerfully coupling voiceover narration from the apollo astronauts reflecting on the most significant events of their lives, with the images that they themselves shot (in their ships, on spacewalks, in lunar orbit and on the moon itself) gives us an immediate sense of just how big this mission was and how blessed they felt to be a part of it. we see their giddiness at the first few hours of weightlessness, the awe and isolation they felt while floating tethered to their ships in the vastness of space (palpable indeed), and we can almost feel the radical shift in perspective they experience as they watch earthrise for the first time while coming around the moon. this movie will draw you in and make you feel , and it\u2019s not every documentary that\u2019s capable of that. absolutely incredible. the bridge (eric steel, 2006, 94 minutes) o\u2019neill media center rc569 .b75 2007 the critic robert warshow once wrote that, \u201cto watch the suffering and death of real people in a movie is an ambiguous experience, and it would be a kind of moral outrage to make that experience an object of art criticism.\u201d in the bridge , you see a man, seemingly calm and wearing a polo shirt, leap to his death in the third minute. this is the first of many suicides captured in the movie. i, in agreement with warshow, won\u2019t try to evaluate these scenes in any way, but i will tell you that to watch them is a singular experience and that the bridge is a documentary you will not forget. more than 20 people end their lives by jumping from the golden gate bridge each year, thousands have done so since it was completed in 1937 and it is the most popular destination for suicides in the world. director eric steel and his crew filmed the bridge from dawn until dusk every day in 2004 and managed to capture 24 jumps; one person survived. it\u2019s impossible to shake a certain feeling of guilty voyeurism when watching these scenes, and the film doesn\u2019t shy from the issue. but it also does what it can to make something more than morbid curiosities of them by interviewing friends and family of the deceased so that we begin to get a sense of the troubled, but loved, people that they were. we hear from grieving friends, mystified bystanders who accidentally caught a glimpse of someone\u2019s last moments, and even from proactive observers who jumped in to pull people back as they were about to make the plunge. i found the most gripping interview to be that of kevin hines, the lone jump survivor in the film, a young man with schizophrenia who hits the water and is convinced of god\u2019s intervention when a porpoise seems to lead him to the surface. i would not argue with him. his account is riveting and is only one of many. the bridge makes no grand statements about suicide or morality or responsibility or even the ethics of observation in a movie such as this. it doesn\u2019t have to. you can make those judgments for yourself... or not. this film, like the bridge itself, is just there, inviting you to regard it. christianity: the first thousand years / christianity: the second thousand years (bram roos, 2001, 400 minutes) o\u2019neill media center br145.2 .r57 2001/ br145.2 .c47 2001 over the last decade or so a&e network has steadily challenged pbs for the title of the best us network producer of quality documentaries. their lavish, lucid and incredibly well researched films have consistently been able to take sprawling subjects (such as the centuries-long dark ages) and mold them into entertaining and deeply informative films that you can return to again and again. with their 8-hour long epic on the history of christianity they pretty much outdid themselves. the scope and ambition of this project is just astounding. beginning very shortly after the death of christ this project (across 2 dvds) examines the survival of the early church in the face of roman persecution, the adoption of the faith by the empire, its spread to the east as rome fell, the stand against viking hordes, its first encounter with islam, the great schism, the renaissance renewal, the emergence of protestantism, the ensuing inquisition, the spread to european colonies all over the globe, and christianity\u2019s reaction to modernity. in the end you\u2019ll find this ambition justified several times over. this is not a production about jesus christ, or his teachings or faith; although those are all discussed. it is a historical investigation into the emergence, spread, survival and influence of christianity over the last 2000 years. no matter what your background or beliefs it can\u2019t be denied that this force has influenced the course of human civilization like few others. this film lays it all out in the most interesting way possible and after 8 hours you\u2019ll be left wishing there were more. this is what general-audience, television-based documentaries are all about. wes hazard , media services assistant, o'neill library bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Documentaries", "refURL":

wild things | greener o'neill | upward bound | campus wildlife | tml spring 2008 what's the tml? by margie battaglia the theology and ministry library (tml) opened in september 2007 on the brighton campus. after only a few weeks, bc students discovered that the library building, straight out of the 1960s, is a great place to study. it is very, very quiet, especially at night. what about the books located there? there are about 170,000 books on the shelves of the library, the great majority related to catholicism, religion and theology. there are many unique books in the collection too \ufffd some dating as far back as 1400. rare books however do not circulate and some will be moved to the burns library on the chestnut hill campus to preserve them in the proper environment. the library will be open through spring exams 2008. on may 15 the library will close for renovations and re-open in september 2008. also during the summer, the collection will be expanded when the weston jesuit school of theology collection, currently located in cambridge, is merged with the existing materials. the renovations will correct some of the problems you may have noticed if you have visited the library: very limited access to electrical outlets and no wireless or network connections at all. other renovations that will take place in the summer include new lighting, the addition of a ramp to make the building more accessible; new restrooms; and the upgrades to electrical and data connections. the materials located at this newly acquired library are listed in quest with a location of theology and ministry library. the books circulate to st. john\ufffds seminarians, faculty and staff as well as to boston college students, faculty and staff with the same loan periods as those for other boston college library materials. at present there is no delivery from the library to the main campus so you must visit the library to borrow materials. you can return them to any bc library. the library is currently open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. monday through thursday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on friday. for more information and directions to the library call 617-552-0549. 16th century books margie

provided input into the libraries strategic planning process in late february and early march by participating in four separate focus group sessions, conducted by deetta jones of deetta jones & associates . each session featured four separate scenarios that envisioned different versions of the library of the future. attendees were asked to read each scenario separately, then judge it on a scale of 1-10 as well as assign a name to the scenario. attendance was very good and the participants enjoyed free pizza, prizes (coffee mugs, water bottles and a 16 gigabyte flash drive) and spirited discussion - sometimes very passionate - as to how bc's libraries will move forward. the feedback is being incorporated into the boston college libraries' new strategic plan. ask a librarian 24/7 |

portrait spring 2010 someone's watching you: the new tip o'neill portrait in o'neill library by kevin tringale ever get the feeling you're being watched? well you are...sort of. above the circulation desk in o'neill library is a new portrait of thomas p. \"tip\" o'neill, the famous alumnus whose name is above the entrance of the building. the striking portrait of the late u.s. speaker of the house is in fact a study for the final portrait which now hangs in the speaker's lobby of the u.s. capitol. being a study may explain why it looks unfinished or incomplete. the portrait ( 18\"x20\" ) was painted by american master realist artist robert vickrey, n.a. (1926- ). vickrey's paintings, drawings, and watercolors are in permanent collections in over 80 leading american art museums including the metropolitan museum of art, the whitney museum of american art, national portrait gallery of the smithsonian, brooklyn museum, and many others. tip o'neill portrait photo by kevin tringale the \"life study\" was done in the summer of 1986 at vickrey's studio on cape cod when tip o'neill selected him as the artist for his portrait in the house speaker's lobby. the study is done in egg tempera which according to grove art online is a paint made using egg yolk as the binding medium instead of oil or water. this technique goes back to antiquity. the piece was recently cleaned and framed and now commands its spot overlooking the o'neill lobby. more can be learned about the artist in the biography robert vickrey: the magic of realism (bapst art stacks nd1839 .v52 e45 2008) and his book written with diane cochrane new techniques in egg tempera (bapst art stacks nd2468 .v52). kevin tringale, senior reference assistant, o'neill library ask a librarian 24/7 | research guides by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past

edward j. kane comic collection at the burns library by david richtmyer an exciting addition to the special collections available to the bc community through the john j. burns library is the edward j. kane collection of comics. this donation, from dr. kane, professor of finance at boston college, was no small gift: there are over 11,000 issues that span all of the eras of comic book publishing, cover every genre and format, and encompass both mainstream and independent publishers. the kane collection is a recent acquisition and is not yet fully available to researchers. we invite all comic enthusiasts to visit the library and browse a selection of issues. remember, we do not have every issue of every title. check the burns library hours before you come over. the golden age of the comic book industry in this country encompassed the late 1930s through the mid-1950s. representative examples of issues from this era in the collection include batman no. 13, nov. 1942 , a typical issue of the time. three separate stories are included, the feature being the \"separation\" of batman and robin in \"the batman plays a lone hand!\" the story begins with bruce wayne, the batman, disowning dick grayson, who is robin the boy wonder. no less a villain than the joker plays a part in this story. with 64 pages in the issue, there was room for two other features plus short, light-hearted one-page fillers, like jerry the jitterbug , and a two-page, non-illustrated short story entitled sacrifice by eric carter. batman was a product of the comic publisher dc, which also produced the titles superman , action comics , the flash, green lantern , aquaman , wonder woman ,and others. from the start dc had competition in the form of timely comics' (the predecessor to marvel comics) the human torch , the sub-mariner and captain america . the first two appear in the human torch, vol. 1, no. 13, fall, 1943 , which, like the batman issue above, feature wwii-era topics with the attendant racial and ethnic stereotypes typical of that time in the u.s. weighing in at a trimmer 54 pages, the human torch replicates the format found in batman: three features, a two-page, non-illustrated short story, but no one-page fillers. a beloved character in american comics, walt kelly's pogo , is represented in the collection with pogo possum, no. 13, july-sept., 1953 . pogo was a long-running strip in daily newspapers that featured political and social satire through the adventures of characters like pogo possum, albert alligator, miz mam'selle hepsibah (a skunk), and many more. kelly often employed unique fonts in his character's word balloons; for example deacon mushrat (a muskrat), uses blackletter text in his word balloons, and p.t. bridgeport, a character modeled after p.t. barnum, used circus poster-like background in his word balloons. the silver age of comics, from roughly the mid-1950's through the early 1970's, took the comic form and refined the artistic style as well as the sophistication of the stories. in the early-to-mid 1950s there had been a lull in comic sales as comic books were portrayed as contributing to juvenile delinquency; the result was a sales slump for the industry. to counter this effect the publisher dc revived their super hero titles with beautiful artwork (though featuring somewhat simplistic stories). often pairing a couple of superheroes together \ufffd one strong character plus another that could not justify his or her own separate title, the atom and hawkman no. 44, sept. 1969 , is a representative example. marvel, dc's chief competitor, took a different approach. while the artistic style of their comics improved as well, so too did their stories, which became more subtle and complex. the characters of the silver age expressed doubt in themselves, an introverted assessment that the simplistic characters of the golden age would have never brooked. marvel even used classical literature to buttress their stories, with the iliad being exemplified in marvel classics comics, vol. 1, no. 26 . still, comic books from this era represented an innocent joy that would soon disappear \ufffd perhaps forever \ufffd following the social and cultural upheavals of the late 1960s and the early 1970s. batman annual no. 6, 1963-1964 , nicely represents this innocence and provides an interesting foil for the batman that was to follow. there is no attempt at social critique, no deviance from accepted mainstream values, and certainly not even a hint at darker themes. this would soon change. the bronze age of comics followed the silver age (click here for a brief explanation as to the origin of these categories), a result of vietnam and the late 1960s. topics never approved under the comics code authority were now, albeit haltingly, broached. sex, drug use, horror and violence of a graphic nature found there way back into an industry that had drummed those topics out in an attempt to survive the mccarthy era. darker tones became prominent, and the cover of our featured issue of this era, bizarre adventures, vol. 1, no. 34, feb. 1983 , seems light years from that of the batman annual no. 6. the modern age of comics, from roughly the late 1980s through the present is represented by the bulk of the kane collection. the stories are much more sophisticated and aimed at an older, more literate audience. compare batman annual no. 9, 1985 with the batman annual no. 6 above. sexually explicit and often extremely violent, as the covers of catwoman annual 2, 1995 and case files: sam & twitch no. 21 typify, the darker themes of these comics harken back to the early \ufffd50s horror titles of ec comics like tales from the crypt and the vault of horror . daredevil: yellow, vol. 1, no. 6, jan. 2002 follows sophisticated plot lines, and the remarkable worlds of professor phineas b. fuddle, no. 1 hardly exemplifies the themes that appear in the last two decades of the 20th century. as the material and audience changed from earlier times, so did the distribution and sales of the magazines themselves. comics in the golden and silver ages were usually sold in drug stores and newsstands; comic book stores per se did not exist. that would change with the coming of the counter-culture in the 1960s. \"underground\" comics, as exemplified by r. crumb's zap comix no. 2 , defiantly did not adhere to the comics code and thus could not be sold at regular newsstands. initially sold in \"head shops,\" stores that catered to hippie culture, these comics sold in impressive enough numbers to justify whole stores devoted to sale of comic books alone, and thus was born the comic book store. with this explosion of sophistication in the industry came a concomitant sophistication of the marketing of comics. a vast speculative market grew up around comics in the 1980s, and large sums of money parted hands over certain issues from the golden and silver ages. in response to this fevered growth the publishers responded by often producing collector's items; our next item, sabretooth special, vol. 1, no. 1, 1995 , shows off its foil-stamped cover designed to appeal to collectors. graphic novels, lengthier, often perfect-bound books began to be marketed from the mid-1970's onward. whole sections of mainstream bookstores like borders now display graphic novels, with themes that are a far cry from the comics of the golden and silver ages. batman: the killing joke is a representative example, as are marvel graphic novel no. 4: the new mutants and blackhawk book one: blood & iron . the success of underground comics showed others that producing an independent line of comics could be financially viable, and this period saw an explosion of independent publishers like dark horse comics, kitchen sink comics, and many others. the kane collection has a sizeable number of titles produced by these publishers, including the green hornet no. 1 , will eisner's spirit magazine, no. 38, dec. 1982 , and best of the west, no. 34, 2003 . comic \"fanzines\" are also represented in the kane collection. these magazines sprang up to cover the comic book scene; many became professionally produced and had fairly long runs. two such journals in the kane collection are represented by collector's dream, vol. 1, no. 2 [1976?] and amazing world of dc comics . within the last 30 years comic book scholarship has become widespread; large collections and even whole libraries have been devoted to this aspect of popular culture. here too the kane collection has representative titles, including the catalog of an exhibition held at the ohio state university, the american comic book: an exhibition at the ohio state university, may 19-august 2, 1985 , and issues from a scholarly journal devoted to the comics industry, inks vol. 1, no. 1 . the kane collection is a recent gift, and because of its size is still undergoing processing. however we invite your perusal of this collection while this is happening and hope you find your trip to the burns library pleasurable and rewarding. david richtmyer , senior cataloger, john j. burns library ask

werewolf...and worked in the cutthroat new york publishing industry? if the answer to that interests you in the least, then wolf is most definitely for you. a persuasive and subtly executed examination of what it might actually be like to live and work in modern manhattan as a werewolf. excellent performances by nicholson and james spader make this an overlooked gem. arachnophobia (dir. frank marshall, 1990, 103 minutes) pn1997 .a73 1999 if you're not afraid of spiders, this movie will go a long way toward fixing that. if you are afraid, and you decide to watch this, you really need to think about how much sleep you can do without in the weeks following. waves of spiders cascade down walls and across ceilings, they lurk in the barn, in the basement and in the shower, quadruple sets of pitiless eyes get lingered on in close-up shots, pulsing egg sacs overflow with baby 8-leggers, and on and on. not much evidence to go on, but this is probably among the greatest bug-wrangling achievements in recent cinema history. on top of everything else, it's got a few great laughs. ravenous (dir. antonia bird, 1999, 101 minutes) pn1997 .r384 2005 it seems odd to describe a movie about supernatural cannibalism as elegant , yet with its reflective characters, compelling score, and ethical musings ravenous is definitely a cut above your average flesh-feast flick. american soldiers on the western frontier in the mid 19th century are led on a search and rescue mission by a mysterious stranger who is definitely not what he appears to be. if you need something to survive, are there limits to what you can do in order to get it? this is a careful film which uses buckets and buckets of blood without ever feeling exploitative or over the top. music from damon albarn (the guy behind gorillaz ). leprechaun (dir. mark jones, 1993, 92 minutes) pn1997 .l477 2004 jennifer aniston would probably like you to forget the first feature film she ever made. but really, after you've seen a demonic version of the lucky charms mascot kill a man by jumping on him with a pogo stick, the experience tends to stay with you. neither the most lavish production nor the sharpest dialogue, but its sheer absurdity will keep you watching until the leprechaun spits his last rhyme (yes, he tends to talk in couplets). followed by classics such as leprechaun 4: in space , and leprechaun in the hood ... yes, really. inside (dir. bustillo/maury, 2007, 83 minutes) pn1997.2 .i6753 2008 by far the best of the recent wave of french gore films. a pregnant photographer, alone on christmas eve, must fend off a scissor-wielding madwoman who's dead set on doing some very bad things . well made, well acted, and truly scary, this film manages to combine a ceaselessly gloomy mood with enough \"oh my god! what was that?!\" scares to keep you peeking through your fingers from start to finish. be warned: extremely graphic and not for the faint of heart. the thing (dir. john carpenter, 1982, 109 minutes) pn1997 .t476 2004 you're a team of scientists stationed at a completely isolated antarctic outpost with no means of escape and no contact with the outside world. you realize that there's a parasitic alien among you, which can assume the body of anyone it attacks, and it's picking you off one by one. who do you trust? how do you make everyone believe you're human? and how can you kill it? decisions, decisions. a tight script and fantastic special effects in the hands of the man who did the original halloween ...classic. jacob's ladder (dir. adrian lyne, 1990, 113 minutes) pn1997 .j336 1998 tim robbins (four years before shawshank ) is a postal worker back from vietnam, uncomfortable in life, and rapidly beginning to doubt his sanity as he experiences flashbacks from the war and personal tragedy at home. less a horror movie than the waking nightmares of a man on the edge, filmed as they appear to him. the inspired design, potent special effects (no cgi!), and masterful direction allow us to experience one man's psyche in crisis, from the inside out. measured and sympathetic performances by all, thoroughly worthwhile. the orphanage (dir. juan antonio bayona, 2007, 105 minutes) pn1993.5 .s7 o7 2008 a four foot tall figure with a smiley-face burlap sack on its head isn't that scary if you're sure it's just a kid having fun with a mask...but if you begin to have doubts, you might not feel so safe. a woman returns to her past in an attempt to re-open the orphanage she was adopted from as a child and things get creepy real quick. this is a film that takes its time to establish a solid foundation of dread, delivers its scares, and then goes even deeper into the story than we had a right to expect. a slow burning, truly frightening, spanish-language treat.

in ill by elizabeth rodriguez a&s '11 this summer i had the pleasure of working in the interlibrary loan (ill) office at o'neill library. i should note that i have been working in the ill office as a student worker since my freshman year. i am now a junior, and i have become fascinated with how the library works ever since starting this job because of the positive influence from the ill staff. i am from wichita falls, texas and am a double major in philosophy and film studies, so i get the popular question at dinner parties, \"so what are you going to do with that?\" for the longest time, i really had no idea because i knew i did not want to become a professor of philosophy and the film business is very tough to get into and is not something one can rely on for a steady salary. i have also been involved in the organization of latin american affairs (i am the secretary this year) since my freshman year. i love knowledge and being able to help others attain knowledge about subjects they are normally not familiar with such as the latino culture (how diverse it is). as a philosophy major, i love obtaining knowledge and it has helped me to think with \"the bigger picture\" in mind. while working in ill this summer, i realized that working in the library is what i really enjoy doing because i am surrounded with thoughts that have been written down for the rest of the world to read and contemplate, as well as being surrounded by people seeking knowledge through their use of library materials for their studies, research, and own leisure. after completing my first whole summer (may to september) away from home and in a 9-5 job, i have considered pursuing a higher education in obtaining a degree in library and information science. not only has working in ill helped me in experience of how it feels to hold a job (9-5) or the time management needed to hold a work-study job (12 hrs/wk) but it has also made me more familiar with how to use the library to my advantage. this has come in handy especially when writing research papers and final papers. the library can be intimidating and it's easy to resort to only sources that are online, instead of searching the quest catalog for what the shelves may hold. even if one looks through the catalog and finds there is nothing pertaining to the subject one wants to write about, one can become easily discouraged and try to change their topic to something the library does have scholarship on. with a little planning ahead of time, one does not have to resort to changing a topic of a paper to something that is less interesting, one can obtain materials that are related to the subject you want to write or learn more about with the help of ill. elizabeth rodriguez '11 from o'neill ill photos by kevin tringale what is ill? men and women for others: meet the ill staff anne kenny is the manager of the ill department. she oversees both the borrowing and lending esther duray is the lending coordinator in ill. duray commutes a fair distance every morning to get to work, where she never takes a break, unless it's lunch time, to make sure every request (from other libraries) that comes in is given ample attention, deciding whether or not bc is able to lend the materials requested. duray sets a great example for the students that have worked in ill over the years. duray runs the lending side of ill with the help of graduate and undergraduate student workers who pull the materials from the bc libraries and prepare them to be shipped off across the state, country, or world. on the borrowing side, there's daniel saulean and kate cavanaugh. saulean is efficient and knows the policies of the library like the back of his hand. saulean is currently finishing his degree in library and information science and working at mit in addition to ill in o'neill library. anytime i have a question about what i am supposed to do in terms of my job or the policies of the libraries in general, i ask him. he is knowledgeable and has been a great mentor to me in terms of bettering my knowledge in general, in my academics, and about what places in boston i should make it out to before i graduate. cavanaugh is an alumnus of penn state where she earned her degree in elementary education. cavanaugh is efficient and makes sure the student workers in the office are on the same page as the ill staff by sending emails about meetings and answering any questions they may have about their tasks. if you have ever called the main ill office phone, chances are that she is the one you talk to. cavanaugh treats everyone with kindness. cavanaugh has also acted as an unofficial mentor, because she is closer in age to me than the rest of the ill staff and finished her undergraduate degree not too long ago. although the latest addition to the ill staff (starting in march 2007) she is by no means less knowledgeable about how to run the ill office; in fact, sometimes it is the rest of the staff asking cavanaugh what new changes have occurred in the office if there is an upgrade. setting the world aflame lending side of ill gets backed up by hundreds of requests that pour in each day, someone from

was started strictly as an instructional collection, purchases were made based on faculty needs and it only circulated for classes. over the years, we saw that need overlapping with student demands. the staff at the media center, and the libraries' subject specialists , have been working very hard to build a collection that holds great documentaries, a phenomenal foreign film collection, complete television series , and award winning feature films. all of our holdings are listed in quest. to search for a video or dvd, follow these directions . from quest, you can see if a title is already checked out, or if it is on reserve. keep in mind the media center moves fast and items can be unavailable quickly. victoria farrell '11 and van nguyen '11 from o'neill media center photo by kevin tringale not only do we help faculty acquire titles for their classes, but we also encourage students and student groups to suggest titles for their academic needs. to see what new items have been

student group? contact the digital media librarian, julie decesare, decesarj@bc.edu . many documentaries in the collection have been purchased with public performance rights, which means they can be shown at events on campus. for example, titles like \"the corporation\", \"the future of food\", \"dreamworlds\", and the series \"eyes on the prize\" are a just a few titles that can be screened by student groups. if we don't have the correct licensing, media technology service's film & video rental office can help. the bc libraries and the media center support a streamed film collection available to members of the bc community. the streamed film collection holds full-length films from educational media vendors. the library has purchased the digital rights to convert these videos and dvds, all of which are from the o'neill media center collection, and make them available online to the bc community. each film is streamed as a real media file (download real player ) through the bc libraries' digital collections . these online films are available only to the boston college community and you need a bc username and password to access the collection. right now, we have close to 100

section about the rankings/methodology furnished by the magazine. of course, few topics in education are as controversial as rankings in education. the issue engenders an extremely wide range of views. indeed, the rankings of universities, and the programs taught at them, tend to be both loved and hated by university administrators, faculty, students, parents, prospective applicants. a cynic might observe that those whose own institutions and programs score highly in rankings are inclined to favor the ranking system whereas those whose institutions and programs do not fare so well are more likely to be critical of them. still, numerous individuals are quite objective in proffering both positive and adverse criticism of the methodologies used and conclusions reached by those organizations and individuals who conduct university and program rankings. certainly there's a prolific body of literature critiquing such rankings. one of bc libraries' research guides, educational rankings hispanic magazine 's listing of the top 25 colleges for latinos ; kiplinger's magazine 's 100 best values in public colleges ; the philosophical gourmet's ranking of graduate programs in philosophy in the english-speaking world ; the economist 's rankings and overview of the world's top 100 mba programs ; the times higher education 's top 200 world universities ; and many other rankings. while some of the information contained in these ranking sites is clearly useful as well as being interesting, it would be wise to bear in mind that an appropriate motto for anyone using these sites and links might be caveat lector educational rankings research guide you might also want to delve into the rankings controversy to consult some of the documents in the problems with

then there are death insulting acts. philippe petit insulted death. in august of 1974, he strung a tightrope between the twin towers of the world trade center and walked, danced, and sat on it for 45 minutes. the feat was absolutely astounding and in no way has it diminished over time. this doc traces petit's efforts from his initial inspiration for the stunt all the way to its execution. building inevitably toward what we know will be a successful outcome, it manages to grab us not only with the amazing (and still apparent) physical abilities of its narrator/protagonist, but also with the heist-film suspense techniques it employs to tell the story of how petit managed to pull off \"the artistic crime of the century\". it involved recruiting international help, scouting the then-under-construction wtc for years, and ingeniously managing to hang a 450lb cable across a 140ft gap that was a quarter mile off the ground. an amazing act and an amazing film. tyson (dir. james

he was able to win his matches before the bell was rung, by pure intimidation. you could see it in his opponents' eyes: not the fear but the knowledge that they were going to lose. then it all fell apart. he married disastrously, got careless, lost his titles in one of sport's biggest upsets, was sent to prison, and generally did everything possible to cultivate the public persona of a raging lunatic. (he also got a pretty funny recent cameo in the hangover ). this documentary is more than all of that though. it gets underneath whatever perceptions you had about the man and fighter simply by allowing him to talk. listening to tyson get raw about his youth, his mentor, his enemies, and his fears is unusual enough. then he genuinely gushes with pride about the school achievements of his young children and you're kind of shocked at what you're witnessing. whether you like boxing or tyson, or not, this will own your attention. word wars (dir. eric chaikin / julian petrillo, 2004, 80 minutes) gv1507 .s3 w67 2005 for must of us, it's something we use to kill time when the power goes out or when we're hanging at grandma's house. for the men in word wars however, scrabble is an obsession, a compulsion, and (in many cases) a livelihood. the film follows a group of tile junkies in the months leading up to the national scrabble association championships in san diego (grand prize: $25,000...and yes...we have a national scrabble association). we see three-time champ joe edley, a \"rock star\" on the competitive circuit, who uses a serene calm and conspicuous zen meditation to psych out his opponents. there's joel sherman, an affable and pasty uber-geek whose volcanic gastric juices earn him the nickname \"g.i. joel\". and we meet the brash but reflective marlon hill, a militant black scrabble expert who bristles at the fact that he's a master of the very words he feels are used to oppress him. definitely watch this. if you love scrabble you'll love this film, if you're indifferent to the game you'll still be amazed by how many interesting (crazy?) people devote their lives to it. the mormons (dir. helen whitney, 2007, 240 minutes) bx8611 .m67 2007 pbs is the rolls royce of documentary labels. their productions are always expansive, fascinating, well researched and slickly produced. all of these qualities are evident in this frontline examination of mormonism. beginning at the beginning, this four-hour program looks at the religious movement's founding, its turbulent struggle to survive in the face of universal opposition, its major scandals and controversies, and its transformation into a modern-day faith with global reach and extensive political clout. if you're at all interested in the origins, practices, ideology or impact of mormonism, this is a fantastic resource. crazy love (dir. dan klores / fisher stevens, 2007, 92 minutes) hq801.83 .c73 2007 we all know a couple that just has no business being together. they don't share interests, they fight all the time, and you can't think of a single thing either of them could possibly see in the other. burt and linda pugach make the couple you might know look like claire and heathcliff huxtable. this is a movie about maybe the most obsessive, unhealthy, outrageous and weirdly enduring relationship you'll ever see. there's an initial meet-cute, elaborate wooing, violence, prison time, reconciliation, scandalous adultery and then more reconciliation. not the most well-made documentary ever, but the insane story and unbelievable characters make it more than worth it. when it's over you might be confused, uplifted, amused or just enraged, but you will definitely think better of that couple that you know. helvetica (dir. gary hustwit, 2007, 80 minutes) z246 .h454 2007 you're more familiar with the subject of this documentary than you can possibly imagine...scarily so. you've encountered it every day, countless times per day, for years and yet you've probably never even thought about it. this is understandable. after all, how often do you seriously think about fonts? that just might change after you watch helvetica , a film about the most ubiquitous and influential typeface of the last sixty years. used for street signs, tax forms, operating systems, and (most pervasively) advertising, helvetica has a truly global reach and resonance. using the font as a point of departure this doc launches into an appealing examination of culture, marketing, and human expression. watching it, you'll gain a better appreciation of how the smallest of stylistic choices can affect how people perceive their data. with an eclectic soundtrack and great interviews this is the best movie you'll ever see about a font. (note: be sure to check out the extended interview with typographer erik spiekermann on the dvd extras. the wild conversation of this microsoft bashing motor-mouthed german is something you don't want to miss.) freestyle: the art of rhyme (dir. kevin fitzgerald, 2000, 60 minutes) m1630.18 .f74 2005 if this movie wasn't half as good as it is, it would still be worth a watch for the pure weirdness of seeing ?uestlove before he had an afro. but seriously, whether you're a hip-hop fan or not you'll find freestyle to be totally honest, cool and compelling. it interviews a broad range of spoken word artists, modern rappers, and past legends as they talk about (and practice) the thing they love most. while briefly looking at the history of the art, freestyle focuses mainly on recent practitioners and the politics of improvisational rhyming. of definite interest is the story arc about the legendary series of battles between underground stars supernatural and juice. (note: the dvd comes with a sweet feature that allows you to watch the film \"freestyle\" with the different chapters appearing in random order.) riding giants (dir. stacy peralta, 2005, 102 minutes) gv839.5 .r53 2005 i walked into this movie not knowing a damn thing about surfing aside from what the keanu reeves/patrick swayze film point break had taught me (not much). i walked out with an absolute reverence for the sport and its many innovators. riding giants is directed by stacy peralta, the former pro skater who also made dogtown and z-boys . he brings his trademark visual flair, copious archival footage, and knack for sound tracking to his look at the development and popularization of big wave surfing over the last six decades. if you've never touched a surfboard it won't matter. it's impossible not to be amazed when sixties icon greg knoll talks about taking a 50/50 chance for survival to surf a monster wave during a hawaii storm, or when you hear that for over a decade jeff clark paddled for hours out to some of the most dangerous water in the world just to surf alone. the best look at the sport and art of surfing that someone with no knowledge of it could hope for. wes hazard , media services assistant, o'neill library ask a librarian 24/7 | research guides by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Films", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2010spring/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "ugrads@bc.library - news YOU can use", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2010spring/article3.html", "text": "ugrads@bc.library - news you can use this issue: smartphone | stained glass | nightingale | films | student courier | portrait spring 2010 students discover florence nightingale by justine sundaram during the week of february 8th, professor stacey barone's nu060 class got a chance to look at some important primary sources from the history of nursing for an extra credit assignment. among the items on display were: the first syringe to administer insulin in new england from the new england deaconess hospital school of nursing collection; a cap that would have been worn by nurses in the 1930s - 1950s at the st. elizabeth's hospital school of nursing; letters written by florence nightingale; and a first edition of florence nightingale's book notes on nursing . etching of florence nightingale photo by kevin tringale the most meaningful pieces in this small display were the letters written by florence nightingale (1820-1910). many things that we take for granted - cleanliness of hospitals and the importance of observing patients - were not common knowledge in her time. and, like many nursing students today, nightingale resisted pressure from family to become a doctor because she truly wanted to make advances in the field of nursing. one of the nightingale letters from the dolan collection, dated july 23, 1881, offers a glimpse into the student-teacher relationship between alice fisher and florence nightingale. alice fisher was an early nursing pioneer. born in england in 1839, she enrolled in the nightingale training school home for nurses at st. thomas' hospital, london in 1875 and went on to become a nightingale nurse of unusual ability. in this letter, nightingale is eager to speak with her former student again. she also asks if fisher knows any nursing students who might be interested in enrolling at nightingale's school for nurses at st. thomas' hospital, \"we have always, of course, many more applications than we can admit, but, also of course, not always of the right calibre (sic) .\" july 23, 1881 letter from florence nightingale to alice fisher photo by kevin tringale the envelope for this letter is addressed to \"miss fisher/addenbrooke's hospital/cambridge\". from the entry on fisher in american nursing: a biographical dictionary (o'neill reference rt34 .a44 1988), it's evident that nightingale wrote this particular letter after fisher had left the nightingale training school and had become the matron of addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge, england. in october 1884, fisher went to america to become the lady superintendant of nurses at the philadelphia hospital. in 1888, she died of heart disease in philadelphia. this letter is a wonderful piece of nursing history, carefully preserved and made accessible in the reading room at the john j. burns library. the nightingale letters owned by the burns library are part of the josephine dolan history of nursing collection, 1855-1987 . a nursing historian and teacher who spent her life advocating for the preservation of primary sources in nursing, dr. dolan donated these letters, along with other teaching materials and artifacts, to the john j. burns library in 1988 and 1990. the bulk of ms. dolan's papers are now held at the dodd research center of university of connecticut in storrs, connecticut; however the burns library's small collection is still fascinating. syringe circa 1922 from new england deaconess hospital photo by kevin tringale primary sources are first-hand accounts of past events. they are generally created by the witnesses or first recorders of these events when they occurred. they can include such things as diaries, letters, reports, photographs, creative works, financial records, memos and newspapers articles. while these letters and others like it are very interesting in and of themselves, primary source documents like these often require you to do background research so that you have a better idea of the circumstances, current events and concerns of the time in which they were written. doing this background research makes you feel a bit like a detective putting the clues of an old case together. interested in looking at more florence nightingale letters? visit the burns library and look at the josephine dolan history of nursing collection, 1855-1987 . also recommended letters of florence nightingale in the history of nursing archive, special collections, boston university libraries (o'neill stacks rt37.n5 a4 1974). this book publishes the large collection of florence nightingale letters available at the howard gotlieb archival research center at boston university. primary sources are accessible in many different ways, so don't hesitate to visit the burns reading room or call or e-mail me if you have any questions. justine sundaram , reference librarian, bibliographer, burns library ask a librarian 24/7 | research guides by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Nightingale", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2010spring/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "Student Employment", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/about/jobs/student/", "text": "student employment skip to main content boston college library ever to excel search bc secondary navigation: a \u2013 z bcinfo maps directories runlibraries();

what to italicize, where to put the periods and what arcane order to list the author and publisher. remembering all these rules is about as easy as reading quantum mechanics in russian (if you\u2019re a russian physics major, please change that analogy to something you\u2019re bad at). still it\u2019s closer to 9am than 8am and your paper is due in minutes. instead of frantically searching your room for your copy of strunk and white, (look behind the refrigerator, that\u2019s where i usually find mine), you can use refworks to format it into any citation style (mla, apa, ama, turabian, chicago, etc.) your professor asks for. refworks is an online program that will import and format your citations for you and generate a bibliography any professor would be pleased to see as part of your paper. and yes, professors have a nasty habit of actually checking bibliographies to see if they\u2019re done appropriately. refworks is best used while you\u2019re working on your paper, you can import the citations directly from the databases you used to gather information and save yourself a lot of time. also, these citations are saved in your refworks account. now refwork\u2019s citation filters are close to 100% accurate but always take a moment to look over your citations to make sure that there aren\u2019t any errors. setting up an account takes between 1 and 5 minutes and it will make doing citations dramatically easier. and isn\u2019t anything that gives you more time to spend \u201cresearching\u201d at your favorite off-campus spot worth the effort? more information on refworks . john walsh is the hult librarian, business specialist and part of o'neill library reference. bc libraries home libweb@bc.edu | ugrads@bc.library review board", "hrefTitle": "", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2006spring/whats/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Social Sciences", "Education"], "title": "BC Libraries Student Bulletin -  News You Can Use", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2006spring/index.html", "text": "bc libraries student bulletin - news you can use spring 2006 in this issue \u00bb looking back\u2014 at spring break james zhen profile a lesson in creativity bibliographies made easy finding online images who's my subject specialist? ask a librarian 24/7 research guides looking back\u2014way back\u2014at spring break the origins of a collegiate rite of spring you may have been away from scholarly pursuits on spring break, but that doesn\u2019t mean the scholars weren\u2019t pursuing you . we\u2019ll spare you the scholarly details here \u2013 consider it a little extension of the break. instead, let\u2019s see what research resources available from the bc libraries reveal about how the spring break phenomenon got started in the first place. it began when swim coach sam ingram of colgate university in upstate new york brought his team to fort lauderdale to swim at the beachfront casino pool \u2013 the first olympic-sized pool in the state of florida. ingram and local officials then organized an annual aquatic forum (later known as the college swim forum). 45, 321 # of books currently checked out of o'neill library 172,666 hits a year most used library database: psycinfo 10,000 a year number of plastic bags given to students men vs. women pew internet & american life project report - view current exhibits - apply for a summer job - take home videos and dvds from the media center by 1938, more than 300 swimmers were competing at the event \u2013 and spreading the word about fort lauderdale as a fun-in-the-sun escape from the cold weather further north. by the 1950s, an estimated 20,000 students were heading to florida each year on spring break. the growing phenomenon drew national attention: time magazine first highlighted spring break in an april 1959 article called \u201cbeer & the beach\u201d and january 1961 saw the release of the spring break-themed hit film \u201cwhere the boys are,\u201d set in fort lauderdale and starring (among others) a young george hamilton. (maybe that\u2019s where he started working on that famous tan.) fort lauderdale remained the number one destination for spring breakers well into the 1980s. it peaked in 1985 \u2013 two years after the release of \u201cspring break,\u201d another movie set there \u2013 when 350,000 revelers descended on the florida city. but by the end of the \u201880s, fort lauderdale had had enough: stricter laws against public drinking were enacted and enforced; mayor bob cox went on good morning america to tell students they were no longer welcome; marketers focused on an older demographic; and by 1992 student visitors were back down to 20-30,000 a year. and what about the casino pool in fort lauderdale, the place where spring break was born? torn down in 1966, the site is host today to history of another sort as the home of the international swimming hall of fame. tracing the history of spring break in the bc libraries the following library sources and services were used in compiling information used in this article: lexisnexis academic , factiva , and the new york times (1851 -

the college did not move to chestnut hill until march 1913. scholars who learnedly discuss the many reasons for the migration of the sons-of-the-irish-immigrants school from the lows of the south end to the heights of chestnut hill might consider as one motivating factor the eagerness of students to view the annual boston marathon earlier in the race to help the runners. arriving in march 1913, members of the bc community would have been able to cheer on and to help the runners in april of that year. my favorite story of a bc student helping a runner occurred in 2006. a woman from hopkinton was stumbling as she passed some of the college students, and one of the freshmen talked to her, gave her some water, encouraged her - and then accompanied her for the rest of the marathon. along the way he asked onlookers to cheer for her, and all this attention cheered her and she did finish. student and runner were separated near the finish line, but she later called bc and an apb located the modern samaritan. sources there is a history of the marathon on the boston athletic association website. boston daily globe ; dec 12, 1896. the announcement of the planned marathon by the baa (i.e. the first boston marathon). boston daily globe ; apr 20, 1897. the pre and post marathon coverage for the first boston marathon boston daily globe ; apr 20, 1898. coverage of the 2nd boston marathon enfranchisement and citizenship: addresses and papers by edward l. pierce, 1896 o'neill microforms microfiche z1236 .l5 lac brehaut, ellerton james, 1897-1985 collector.

you helped name it, now you can use it and help improve it! your classmate who recommended the name holmes sees it as a search tool with the ability to track down even the most obscure books in the furthest reaches of the library. holmes one search, introduced to the boston college community this fall, is designed to make searching the library collections easier and more productive. it is a new search and discovery tool for the quest library catalog, databases, and other digital collections. we are starting with four good reasons to use holmes and we'd like to hear yours. after you search the bc collections, there is no need to navigate to a different page of the library web site to search for journal articles. simply click the articles/databases tab, choose a subject from the drop-down menu, and run the same (or new) search. this is a great way to begin your search for articles. not all databases are currently compatible with holmes so you will need to access those through the libraries databases page . 2) holmes offers \"amazon-like\" features, such as spell-checking, recommended searches, book jackets, summaries, book reviews, and a link to amazon itself for each book. tag it and review it, too. 4) save it: save your results in the e-shelf or export records to refworks, cell phone, or share it on several social networking sites. holmes offers many more options for saving your records. you are no longer tied to system or library supplied sites. give us feedback on how holmes one search is working. it is a system in development and you can help make it better. from tucker margulies, winner of the rename supersleuth: a search & discovery tool contest: \"i saw the stuff up in the library, it looks good. i like what you guys did with the sir author conan doyle quote. when i submitted my entry i had both the name holmes and sherlock in mind. i liked the parallel between sherlock holmes' incredible ability to track down criminals through thick fog with the search tools ability to track down even the most obscure books in the furthest reaches of the library. i used the beta version a few times and it was able to find rare copies of works by sir richard burton from the mid 1800's. that was my basic thinking. everyone has childhood memories of sherlock holmes as a clever detective who always finds the criminal and hopefully soon holmes search will have the reputation of a tool that always finds the right book.\" ed tallent , head librarian research & instructional services, o'neill library who's my subject specialist | ask a librarian 24/7 | research guides by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Holmes", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2008fall/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "ugrads@bc.library -

one of which resembles a club and is entitled\"vote persuader\" - one gets the sense that tip o'neill was a political man with a healthy sense of humor. thomas p.\"tip\" o'neill was a great man and a great statesman. from his achievements in education and the environment, to those in medicare, medicaid, and social security, his accomplishments were notable and his oft-repeated phrase,\"all politics is local,\" will go down in history. there are few, if any, political men today with tip's devotion to serving the people in his district, whether it was through jobs, social services, or simply acting in accordance with his conscience. for that reason alone, it is worth taking a few minutes to visit the exhibit to learn more about his life and work. tip's donkey collection, his diplomatic reception of odd gifts, and his love of honey glazed donuts, only help to fill out a picture of a man who was not afraid to be proud to call himself a politician. the thomas p.\"tip\" o'neill exhibit is located on level 2 of the o'neill library and is open 11:00am to 3:00pm, monday through saturday. brenna r. mcmahon , gsas, 2013, political science brenna has worked in the thomas p.\"tip\" o'neill exhibit for 2 1/2 years who's my subject specialist | ask a librarian 24/7 | research guides by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Tip Exhibit", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2008fall/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Government, Politics and Law", "Government Information", "U.S. Government Information"], "title": "ugrads@bc.library -

(many more historical newspapers are available in harder-to-use but content-rich microform collections.) get alternative views on a wide range of topics from non-mainstream newspapers via such sources as ethnic newswatch , alt-presswatch , genderwatch , and others. read translations of articles from non-u.s. newspapers and other news sources in world news connection . browse or search isi emerging markets for the text of newspapers, some in english, some in local languages, from developing countries often overlooked in other sources. a few examples: new vision (uganda); kazakhstanskaia pravda (kazakhstan); diario el mundo (el salvador); oslobodjenje (bosnia-herzegovina); thanh nien news (vietnam). search the full text of hundreds of worldwide newspapers at one time via mega-news databases factiva and lexisnexis academic . leaf through paper copies \u2013 yes, they\u2019re still around -- of dozens of newspapers in the current newspapers section of o\u2019neill library (near the new print stations). so, amid all of these riches in the libraries, what is the future of newspapers themselves? despite the talk of their demise, there are positive signs as well. the world association of newspapers recently reported that global newspaper circulation is up 9.95 percent over five years and 2.36 percent over twelve months. online news sites like google news , newsvine , and others rely on newspaper sources for much of their content. you don\u2019t have to go far, in fact, to see that newspapers still have appeal: just watch how quickly the free copies of the times , globe , and herald disappear from hillside on a weekday morning. the newspaper is dead? long live the newspaper!

the bulk of work for an assignment the bibliography isn\u2019t quick and easy when you have to do it manually. mla, apa, turabian, each has its own special and unique set of rules; what to italicize, where to put the periods and what arcane order to list the author and publisher. remembering all these rules is about as easy as reading quantum mechanics in russian (if you\u2019re a russian physics

professors have a nasty habit of actually checking bibliographies to see if they\u2019re done appropriately. refworks is best used while you\u2019re working on your paper, you can import the citations directly from the databases you used to gather information and save yourself a lot of time. also, these citations are saved in your refworks account. now refwork\u2019s citation filters are close to 100% accurate but always take a moment to look over your citations to make sure that there aren\u2019t any errors. setting up an account takes between 1 and 5 minutes and it will make doing citations

from six walking into bapst library is like walking back in time. the trademark gothic architecture of boston college stands out against the skyscraper backdrop of boston itself. similarly, much of the decorative art found in academic buildings, residence halls, and libraries harks back to a more traditional, familiar style. bapst library, in a wonderfully exciting move, has taken a step away from this. rather than continuing into the traditional stone-walled gargan hall, hang a left or right into to the bapst art library student gallery . there, you will find a world of modern art at its best. the recent exhibit, \u201conce upon a time\u2026the modern fairytale,\u201d is an exhibit of two graphic novels, \u201csix\u201d by russ dauterman (07) and \u201ci wake\u201d by katharina riehle (07), both of which incorporate inspiration and talent to show boston college student artists at their best. six is the story of five psychic young people, recruited to be part of the psychic development initiative, a government agency designed, in a way, after the rotc program. influences from comic books, pop culture, and other art forms, dauterman says, have played a major role in formulating the look and inspiration behind the book, as well as a large part of his own personality coming into the work. done completely by hand and in pencil, the first edition of six is a beautifully drawn depiction of an exceptional teenage experience. psychic abilities aside, dauterman portrays many of the common emotions and tragedies of teenage-hood through his illustrations. even though this edition is yet to be finished, with many drawings still only outlined or partially begun, love, friendship, fear, and everything in between are masterfully drawn out in these selected pages. absence from i wake coming from a very different artistic medium choice, i wake is a photographic and textual journey through adolescence, specifically addressing the issues of isolation, loneliness, and loss of self. \u201ci wrote the story of i wake with the intention of visually communicating its emotional substance to a reader,\u201d riehle says, \u201ci wanted to make a book to make the conversation between artist and audience more personal and intimate, since the display of my own emotions and feelings makes me vulnerable.\u201d the photographs and words used by riehle act more as images than the messages they read as. utilized for shape and size, the words add both text and structure to the piece. unlike dauterman\u2019s work, riehle decided to enlarge her art, stating, \u201cif you look at them big, every flaw and pixel is out in the open; drawing a parallel, my emotions were out there for everyone to see, which is a risk i took by enlarging the pages, a risk which i didn't think i wanted to take but i suppose i'm glad i did.\u201d both extremely talented artists cite boston college professors as inspiration and support for their work and creativity. professor sheila gallagher, of the fine arts department , allowed both students to truly dive into their own creative wells, urging them to produce art that truly was \u201cthem.\u201d other professors, such as professor michael mulhern of fine arts and professor bonnie rudner of english , also had profound impacts on the young artists. six and i wake both fall under the category of graphic novels. graphic novels are loosely defined as any book incorporating pictures, images, or drawings as part of the actually story or message. dauterman identifies his work as a more traditional graphic novel, while also saying six is a mix of \u201cmarvel-commercialable with a fine art background.\u201d riehle\u2019s i wake is more of a new front for the graphic novel genre. she says of her work, \u201ci didn't set out to create a 'graphic novel' i just wanted to tell a story through pictures; the term was assigned to the project later.\u201d dauterman praises the genre as a whole for the general depth and sheer volume of art and artistic expression that fall within its bounds. in looking at the current library collections, both dauterman and riehle noted a great fine arts collection here on campus, located in bapst library. \u201ci can get lost looking through the books,\u201d dauterman notes. with the rise of the graphic novel as a larger art genre than just comic books, both students see room for expansion within the collections, as well as additions of computers and space for the production of more graphic novels by other students here on campus. dauterman and riehle exhibit some of the truly amazing and gifted talent here on campus. they work with inspiration, creating art that truly has a passion behind it. both plan on continuing with their work, hopefully getting it published. in the meantime, the boston college community would be lucky to view more of their exceptional work. jim conti has worked for one year in o'neill library. russ dauterman and katharina riehle are both students in the college of arts and sciences, class of 2007. bc libraries home libweb@bc.edu | ugrads@bc.library review board", "hrefTitle": "", "refURL":

the o\u2019neill media center, because, well, they have films there. media materials nowadays, staffing the counter still remains the favorite part of my job. i like to peruse the stacks, picking the

photo by kevin tringale i have worked at o\u2019neill library for the past 3 years. i started working in the media center my sophomore year and now i also work at the tech center. i really have enjoyed working in the library because of the quiet atmosphere while being behind-the-scenes and getting to know the library staff better. it has been a great learning process and i am able to help not only students but professors and staff too! i am a senior here at boston college majoring in sociology with a minor in theology. my hometown is west palm beach, florida where it is much sunnier and warmer than boston. however, i really love boston and i am glad i came to bc! i am involved in a few organizations on campus, including the vietnamese students\u2019 association and more recently as a health coach for the office of health promotion. i have been applying to graduate schools in order to earn my masters in public health degree after graduation. i am happy to have found a way to connect my sociology major with health because it has been something i have always been interested in. this semester, i am working at the o\u2019neill library tech center twice a week. this job always keeps me on my feet since students are always coming in and out trying to print out their papers. the tech center has four printers that can print double-sided and in larger volumes. there are usually students forming a line to print starting as early as 9am! this year especially has been interesting because it seems like more students are printing which means we order tons of paper to keep up with the demand. additionally, the tech center students are responsible for the copiers, scanners, and fax machine that we have on the third floor of o\u2019neill. our department has worked really hard to make sure that students have enough resources to print, e-mail, and fax their important documents. my favorite machine that the tech center has is the new book-eye scanner located across from the regular printers. we received it over the summer and it has been quite popular. bc patrons can scan their textbooks, papers, and other documents with ease and then have it sent directly to their e-mail. it\u2019s so cool and scans super-fast.. my experience working at the tech center has been a positive one. i am really grateful to work at such great departments for o\u2019neill library. the bc libraries\u2019 staff has been so helpful and make sure that students\u2019 needs are met. it\u2019s a bittersweet feeling knowing that i won\u2019t be working at the library anymore after i graduate. working at both the tech center and the media center have been a rewarding experiences. i highly recommend finding a job at the library! it\u2019s a great place to work with some amazing

tringale every morning bc students get off the shuttle and walk up linden lane past the john j. burns library, the home of special collections at boston college. rare books, manuscripts, music, photographs, and other unique materials are housed in the burns library, along with a staff of archivists, reference librarians, catalogers, and conservators ready to help explore the collections. last semester, over three hundred undergraduates visited the burns library to dive into the world of primary sources: first year composition students looked at \"monsters\" in comic books and propaganda literature, students studying the history of science perused rare works from the 18th century to see how the ideas of isaac newton were first presented, and classes studying irish gothic novels and irish political history were exposed to the burn's impressive irish collections - the best in the country. in 2013 we will celebrate the history of boston college for the 150th anniversary of the founding of bc. you are part of that history - your academic life, the clubs you join, the student publications you contribute to, the athletics you participate in - all are documented in the university archives, another piece of the burns library\u2019s amazing collections. you can see a football program from the 1940s, or the original student handbooks from the 19th century, or photographs of theatre performances from the 1960s. how has bc changed? how has it stayed the same? special collections at burns help tell those stories. photo by kevin tringale as the new associate university librarian for special collections, my job is to make burns a welcoming destination for research, find ways to deliver our resources digitally outside the building, and ensure the collections are preserved for the future - sometimes that\u2019s a tricky balance. make a trip to the burns library part of your bc bucket list. drop by, dig in. check out exhibits of burns material in the o'neill reading room, or visit our digital collections , which range from rare jesuit publications to most issues of sub turri online. for great stories from the burns collections, visit our

fall 2011 overlooked films by wes hazard berry gordy's the last dragon (dir. michael schultz, 1985, 109 minutes) pn1997 .l3783 2005 what do you get when you mix blaxploitation and martial arts, throw in a heaping dose of 80s style, and then soundtrack the entire thing with late-period motown music? unmitigated awesomeness, that's what. yes, financed and produced by berry gordy in the mid 80s, primarily as a musical showcase for the then current roster of motown artists, the last dragon is fun, energetic, insane and just plain earnest enough to make you forget about the underlying ridiculousness of the entire plot. leroy green (martial artist taimak) is a harlem kid and rising kung-fu master who idolizes bruce lee, helps out at his parents' pizza shop, and has no knowledge whatsoever about girls... he also eats popcorn with chopsticks. leroy ( bruce leroy on the streets) becomes the target of the evil sho'nuff (the shogun of harlem , seriously), who wants to prove that he's the baddest fighter in the city, and eddie arkadian, the mafioso video game kingpin who's trying to force leroy's tv-dance-show-emcee love interest into signing a contract for him. if that sounds a bit crazy it doesn't even begin to describe how out-there this movie can seem, all while still making you care about the characters. a hands down cult classic with great fights, better music and dialogue to quote for days. definitely see this movie. moon child (dir. takahisa zeze, 2003, 119 minutes) pn1993.5 .j3 m66 2006 people like to think that stephenie meyer introduced us to sensitive vampires with moral dilemmas, a passion for fashion, and prominent cheekbones. that's not the case... it was actually anne rice. however, somewhere between the two of them this oddity got made in japan and it's definitely worth a watch if you like wistful gangster movies with endless gunfights and somber reflections about the depths of friendship. and yes, svelte vampires. starring two of japan's biggest pop idols at the time (hyde takarai and gackt camui) moon child moon child is something of a modern day obscuro classic. the king of new york (dir. abel ferrara, 1990, 106 minutes) pn1997 .k5646 2004 with all due respect to the man himself, here in 2011 we've gotten to the point where christopher walken appearing in a movie is as much parody as it is acting. the speech pattern, the facial tics, the gameness to appear in pretty much any role with any half-baked dialogue -- these are all reasons why walken has become one of the most prominent and beloved character actors of the last few decades. but they're also why he's become fodder for countless hack stand-up impressions and why a lot of uncreative directors cast him in movies just so he can do his \"crazy-walken-thing\" and (hopefully) sell some tickets. the king of new york is a great reminder of just how intense, serpentine and appealingly crazy walken could (and still can) be when given the right movie. in it he's frank white, a new york kingpin, recently released from prison who has a robin hood complex and more than a few scores to settle. you've seen the crime-boss-on-the-make movie before, probably many times. what makes this film so worthwhile is the style. the attitude and aesthetics of its director (abel ferrara, who did the original bad lieutenant ) are over the top in the best way possible. the racial dynamics of frank's gang and the cops who go up against him are endlessly fascinating. add in a stellar supporting cast (wesley snipes, laurence fishburne, steve buscemi, etc.) and you have one of the better crime films of the 90s. continually referenced by the notorious b.i.g. in his lyrics this is a total gem among new york mob pictures. hell's highway: the true story of highway safety films (dir. bret wood, 2003, 91 minutes) tl152.6 .h44 2003 nowadays in driver's ed classes instructors stress the importance of being careful and responsible on the road by quoting accident statistics and using anecdotes about the tragic consequences of inattention and bad decisions. from 1959-1979 they just cut to the chase and showed american high school students endless 16mm footage of the most grisly and gore-filled real life car wrecks imaginable. i'm not sure if this actually caused a net reduction in motor vehicle deaths, but it certainly did a lot to permanently scar a generation of wide-eyed kids trying to get their learners' permits. hell's highway is a weirdly gripping documentary about a very specific slice of american public education that many people have forgotten or just plain choose not to talk about. looking at the postwar social factors (such as the emergence and empowerment of \"teenagers\" as a demographic to be reckoned with) that led to the (perceived) need for these educational films, and including interviews with those who made them and the educators who showed them, this documentary sheds light on a phenomenon that many today might not be aware of. incorporating copious footage from vintage accident filmstrips, hell's highway is as informative, and as lurid, as the very films it dissects. well worth a watch. (note: the special edition 2 disc dvd contains several vintage full length 16mm gore shorts). riki-oh: the story of ricky (dir. nam nai choi, 1991, 91 minutes) pn1993.5 .j3 r55 1993 pretty much everything about this movie is absurd. the atrocious dubbing, the hammy acting, the cheap (yet inspired) special effects and, most of all, the downright cartoonish another henchman has his abdomen punched through with an accompanying geyser of blood, maybe then you'll look away for a brief second, but you'll be smiling as you do it. there is, up to a certain point, a plot involved in all of this. but it's largely irrelevant. suffice it to say that a noble and near-invincible martial arts master finds himself in a privatized prison with a sadistic drug-dealing warden and a bunch of evil inmate lackeys. fighting ensues. in the end, for all of its gore, there really is no other way to approach this movie than with smiling bemusement. if you absolutely can't deal with onscreen blood, it's probably best to stay away from riki-oh. but if you enjoy mind-blowingly bombastic fight scenes and have an appreciation for the more \"out there\" examples of the martial arts genre you really can't go wrong with this. diva (dir. jean-jacques beineix, 1981, 123 minutes) pq2675 .d5 d5 2000 she's a world famous opera star who refuses to be recorded. he's too much of a fan to resist making a surreptitious tape of a concert. they both end up threatened by a crooked french cop and a gang of murderous taiwanese opera fanatics. there's also a mysterious art collector/armchair detective and his gamine companion who drop in to offer assistance and advice. wonderful. truly. this movie, against all the odds, takes itself completely seriously and ends up fun, memorable, touching and sincere (it includes one of the most charming and most chaste date scenes in memory). you certainly don't have to be an opera fan to enjoy it, but you may end up one. the terrorist (dir. santosh sivan, 1998, 95 minutes) pn1993.5 .i8 t44 200 this movie has, unfortunately, become only more relevant since it was made in 1998. since then, politically motivated suicide attacks have become a staple news story, occurring with startling frequency. we've all probably wondered at some point just what goes through the head of someone in the weeks and days before they carry out such a mission. there is no definitive \"answer\" to that question, but the terrorist offers a glimpse into what one young woman might experience in just such a situation. the film follows malli, 19, a committed warrior for the cause (the name, motives and goals of her organization are never disclosed) with a matter-of-factness and objectivity that is note-perfect for the piece. we know that malli has grown up immersed in this world \"30 missions, all successful\", but the politics involved aren't discussed at all. this movie is about a girl who's chosen to die before she's old enough to have really lived and the things she learns as she prepares herself during the first days of her existence that are not spent in a guerilla jungle camp. just before her attack malli stays with the sage (if goofy) farmer vasu and his comatose wife. he doesn't know her purpose but his effortless wisdom stirs thoughts in her that are alien to the lifelong soldier. you begin to wonder if she'll go through with it after all, but won't know until the last moment of the film. on the way there you'll be treated to one of the most beautifully shot movies imaginable. it has an almost fetishistic obsession with rain, water, and malli's eyes and the requisite technical skill to make it worth it. thoughtful, non-judgemental, authentic and necessary. the american astronaut (dir. cory mcabee, 200, 94 minutes) pn1997 .a647 2005 a space-western/musical... you just don't see a lot of those. set in outer space among random asteroid dive bars and outposts in the bad part of venus, this movie has the feel of a zero-g b western. it's filled with seedy watering holes and vigilantes and drunks looking to fight in saloon bathrooms (but only after they've given you an elaborate song and dance routine). created by and starring members of the band the billy nayer show this is about as eccentric of a movie as you can hope to see, crammed with more glorious what just happened? moments than we deserve. shot on a shoestring budget in stark black and white, the movie follows curtis, a down and out space courier as he attempts to complete a 3-way transfer involving a dead body, the all-female planet of venus, and the only boy from jupiter to have ever seen a woman. loaded with great musical scenes and featuring an incredibly obsessive and thoughtful villain this is a film for anyone who likes their cinema on the weird side. wes hazard , media services assistant, o'neill library ask a librarian 24/7 | research help by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Films", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2011fall/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Nursing"], "title": "ugrads@bc.library - news YOU can use", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2011fall/article3.html", "text": "ugrads@bc.library - news you can use this issue: bapst | tech center | reserves | films | history | what's happening? fall 2011 how course reserves really works by cindy jones so you arrived here at boston college and went to the bc bookstore to purchase your textbooks for fall semester. when you saw the prices, maybe you decided there had to be a cheaper way. well, the good news is in many cases there is a better way: library course reserves. how course reserves works before the semester starts, professors contact reserves staff with a list of what they would like on reserve for their courses. this can be books, course packs, or online readings. if you want to use a book that is on reserve, go to the circulation/service desk of the library where it is supposed to be. for books and course packs the professor chooses which library will house the items for your course. you will need the call number of the book (or at some libraries the course number) because that is how they're arranged behind the desk. if you don't know what a call number is yet, don't worry. in o'neill there is a dedicated mac for looking up call numbers and staff at any of the libraries will be happy to help you. when you find the call number, it's best to write it in your notebook or on your syllabus so you won't have to go through this process again the next time. once checked out to you, you can have the book for two hours to read, photocopy, or scan. if your assignment is an online reading, you don't even need to come in to the library! you can access online readings for your course from any computer, tablet, or smart phone and can read it online or print it out. what happens if you're not finding anything on reserve for your class? ask at the circulation desk and a member of the reserve staff will help you. it could be that your professor didn't ask us to put anything on reserve. or maybe they recently asked us and we need to order the book or get it back from someone who has it checked out. we can let you know what the issue is and how long of a wait you may have. if the professor has not requested reserves, we can get in touch with them and arrange for that. what you can do to help please return reserve books in two hours when they are due. this will allow other members of your class to use the book also. (and it will prevent you from getting overdue fines.) and please don't highlight or write in the books. it's yours, but only for two hours. cindy jones , reserve services supervisor, o'neill library ask a librarian 24/7 | research help by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "Reserves", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2011fall/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Social Sciences", "Education"], "title": "ugrads@bc.library - news YOU can use", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2011fall/article5.html", "text": "ugrads@bc.library - news you can use this issue: bapst | tech center | reserves | films | history | what's happening? fall 2011 sorting out your history questions by elliot brandow where can i find an extensive legislative history of the nixon national health insurance proposal? what is the relationship between then-secretary of state john quincy adams and latin american revolutionary nationalism in the 1820's? what impact did the second world war have on pub life in britain? where can i find some good primary sources to help me compare american anti-irish nativism with anti-semitism? elliot brandow photo by kevin tringale these are just a few of the many topics that students have asked me to help them research in the short time since i joined bc libraries this august as your newest reference librarian. my role is to help you to articulate your topics and to navigate resources that inform your research, allowing you to write better papers, to receive better grades, and ultimately to become more engaged and rigorous scholars. i specifically support the history department -- faculty, majors, and any student with a history-related question. but, the libraries offer research support in all areas and disciplines. before coming to boston college, i worked at wheaton college in norton, ma, and before that at a non-profit resource center inside the boston public library that helps low-income, first-generation students find their way through college and financial aid applications. i'm very excited to join the vibrant (and very busy!) o'neill library and to become a part of such a scholarly and supportive community at boston college. there is an amazing plethora of resources available through the bc libraries, and a fantastic group of energetic, knowledgeable, and friendly staff champing at the bit to offer their support. i highly encourage you to take advantage of how we can make your work and your lives easier. don't bang your head against a wall, overwhelmed by too many results or frustrated with zero. stop by my office (309 -- on the main level of o'neill) or send an email: elliot.brandow@bc.edu if i can be of any help. elliot brandow , senior reference librarian/bibliography for history, o'neill library cover photo by kevin tringale ask a librarian 24/7 | research help by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "History", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2011fall/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Arts", "Art History"], "title": "ugrads@bc.library - news YOU can use", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2011fall/article1.html", "text": "ugrads@bc.library - news you can use this issue: bapst | tech center | reserves | films | history | what's happening? fall 2011 jewel in the crown the architectural gem of the bc libraries by laurie mayville when students and visitors first tour bapst library, designed by the architectural firm of maginnis and walsh in the english collegiate gothic style, they often stop at our information desk in the entryway lobby to ask, \"was this building ever a church?\" though mass was once held in the auditorium (now the renovated kresge reading room) the building was actually built as a library. dedicated in 1928, bapst library served as the main library for boston college until 1984, when the thomas p. o'neill, jr. library opened to accommodate our growing collection of books and technological resources. from 1984 until 1987, bapst library underwent extensive renovation, with the addition of the mezzanine and a newly created circulation area. a separate library, the john j. burns library of archives and special collections, was created in one wing of the building. bapst library became known as \"the quiet place to study\" and has maintained this reputation ever since. in 1993, the art books and art periodicals were moved from o'neill library to bapst library. the main part of the collection--books on painting, architecture, sculpture, drawing, print media, and the decorative arts (call numbers n through nx)--can be found in the art stacks. to enter the art stacks, just walk past the information desk and into the kresge reading room, where you will see a twin staircase leading down to the second floor. (when you enter the building, at the information desk, you are on the third floor.) there are large, oak study tables in the art stacks where you can spread out your books and papers, and also individual carrels for more secluded studying. walking up the stairs and re-entering the kresge reading room, you will find the art periodicals and reference books. there are also ten computers where you can search quest for books owned by the eight separate libraries on the boston college campus and where you will have access to online databases and journals. in the kresge reading room are more individual study carrels, and a twin staircase leads up to the mezzanine, another quiet study area with carrels. when you are studying in the kresge reading room, be sure to look up at the hand-painted beam ceiling, with its colorful geometric and floral motifs. returning to the lobby at the information desk, you will see the irish music center to your left. the irish music center, part of the burns library of archives and special collections, documents irish music in america and works with the center for irish programs to sponsor irish music events on the boston college campus. to learn more about the irish music center, see the irish music research guide and the holdings for irish music, located on their homepage, and stop by to introduce yourself to the staff there. also in the lobby, you will see a twin staircase leading up to gargan hall, on the fourth floor. when you reach the landing where the staircases join to a single flight of steps, note the shakespeare windows, which depict scenes from his plays. also to be appreciated are the wrought-iron balustrades, with a floral design, which lead to the gargan hall foyer. to the left, is the office of the chancellor, rev. j. donald monan, s.j., who served as president of boston college from 1972 until 1996. in the office to the right is the lonergan center, which houses writings by and about bernard lonergan, noted theologian, philosopher, and boston college professor. not to be missed in the foyer itself is the replica of the cathedral ulm in germany, as well as the interior window between the foyer and gargan hall, which describes the genesis of the book in many ancient writing styles. gargan hall, considered one of the most beautiful rooms on campus, is renowned for its stained-glass windows which illustrate the curriculum of studies in jesuit colleges and universities. the windows were created in the studio of boston artist earl sanborn, and descriptions of the stained-glass are posted near every window. for example, the window for theology, in the third alcove on the right, includes panels showing the holy trinity, st. augustine, and st. thomas aquinas. the fine arts window, the last alcove to the left, includes panels of beethoven, leonardo da vinci, and michelangelo. as a whole, each window is comprised of a title panel and a subject panel in the center of the top row, and surrounding panels with the people, symbols, and events related to the subject. for further information on the stained-glass please see the book entitled the bapst library , which you can find through our quest catalog, and for information and pictures of stained-glass in bapst library along with other buildings on campus, see transforming light: the stained-glass windows of boston college , also found through quest . while the main collection of art books is located on the second floor, in the art stacks, photography books (call number tr) and books on museum studies (call number am) are shelved in gargan hall. there are large oak study tables in gargan hall, and oak chairs decorated with linen-fold relief carving. this room is open twenty-four hours, five days a week, beginning sundays at 11:00 a.m. and ending fridays at 5:00 p.m. on saturdays gargan hall is open from 10:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. please check for complete hours on the libraries' homepage. during the final exam period, bapst library and o'neill library both have extended hours. returning to the information desk on the third floor, be sure to visit the student art gallery, located in two rooms downstairs on either side of the entryway foyer. the gallery was founded in 2004, and is run by the student art club, the fine arts department and bapst library. exhibits are held there throughout the academic year. the fall student show will run from november 2 until december 1. bapst library, with its grand architecture and fine detail, extensive collection of art books and periodicals, wireless connectivity, and large areas of study space, is considered one of the most beautiful buildings on campus. indeed, in 2010, the college news website campusgrotto.com voted bapst library first on its list of \"most beautiful college libraries\" . students often refer to it as the \"harry potter\" building and have reported they \"feel smarter\" studying here. bapst library, the quiet library, is truly a gem on the boston college campus. laurie mayville , evening supervisor/reference assistant, bapst library bapst photos by kevin tringale ask a librarian 24/7 | research help by subject bc

roy hill, 1977, 123 minutes) pn1997 .s53 2002 it'd be easy to call slap shot , a caddyshack on skates, but somehow i don't think that would be doing justice to the edgier and more extreme brand of humor in this movie. i don't know much about pro hockey but i found this to be one of the most rewarding comedies i've ever seen, period. if you're actually a hockey fan this will probably end up being a solid gold classic for you (if it isn't already). paul newman leads a struggling minor league squad as an aging player-coach who brings in three brawling, yet totally likeable, ice goons in an effort to stir the fan base and keep the team from folding. hilarity ensues both on and off the ice. what makes this film so successful, aside from the ultra-observant writing, is the diverse cast of players, announcers, front office staff and wives/girlfriends. everyone is distinct and pulls their weight when it comes to boosting the movie's comedy quotient, and newman brings a quiet apprehensiveness to his role as a man fearing what his life will be after hockey when that's all he's ever known. some of the most fun i've ever had watching any comedy or sports film. blue chips (dir. william friedkin, 1996, 93 minutes) pn1997 .b5843 2005 whether it's improper gifts and payments used to land a big name recruit, or shady academic \"assistance\" to a struggling star, or overactive boosters working behind the scenes it seems that every year, in every major college sport, there's a well publicized scandal of some kind. blue chips looks at the choices made by an elite college basketball coach (nick nolte) after his very first losing season. he's followed all of the rules for his entire career but after one bad year he finds himself under immense pressure to do whatever it takes to turn things around. blue chips is great in that it doesn't judge the activities of the coaches, players and \"friends of the program\" we see so much as make us wonder how anyone could expect to remain 100% clean in such a high-stakes, high-profile enterprise with millions upon millions of dollars involved. aside from being a smart indictment of the hypocrisies of elite amateur athletics this movie is just plain fun, featuring cameos from a number of high-profile basketball personalities including larry bird, rick pitino, and bobby knight. best of all: shaq features in a large supporting role as an uber-talented recruit. if you've seen kazaam you might have doubts regarding shaquille o'neal's ability to act, but in a move like blue chips , where he's essentially playing himself, his charisma and comic timing are much appreciated assets. pumping iron (dir. george butler and robert fiore, 1977, 85 mins, documentary) gv546.5 .p86 2003 whether or not bodybuilding is actually a sport is a matter of debate. what's completely indisputable is the fact that pumping iron continues to fascinate more than thirty years after its release. before this film bodybuilding was a relatively fringe pursuit in the us. it took an austrian ex-pat with a thick accent and a flair for showmanship to break through to the mainstream and help usher in the era of obligatorily chiseled action heroes, fitness magazines at every newsstand, and gyms on every corner. while introducing the viewer to a wide and colorful cast of characters, the main arc of the film is arnold schwarzenegger's quest to become a (then record) six time winner of the mr. olympia bodybuilding contest and the attempt by the crazy-intense lou ferrigno (of the incredible hulk tv series) to beat him out for the title. while he was light years away from becoming the action movie icon (and two-term california governor) that we know him as today, it's clear throughout pumping iron that \"ahnuld\" had what it takes to reach the top from the very beginning. even if you hate the very idea of someone spending six hours a day picking up metal and then putting it back down again, it's ridiculously fun to watch schwarzenegger psychologically game his opponents and wax poetic on his competitive focus and love for lifting. plus, the gym scenes are pretty compelling in themselves. a movie of its time that remains fun today. searching for bobby fischer (dir. steve zaillian, 1993, 109 minutes) gv1439 .w35 w35 2006 ok so, chess is definitely not a sport, but if some of the things you admire about athletics include drive, focus, obsession, inexplicable natural gifts and cutthroat competition then searching for bobby fischer is most definitely a sports movie. based on the memoir of the same name by fred waitzkin, father of chess prodigy josh waitzkin, this film explores how a kind-hearted child's remarkable genius for a ruthlessly competitive game affects his relationship with his parents and his sense of self. add in a failed and obsessive chess fanatic (ben kingsley) and a washington square park chess hustler (laurence fishburne) who school the boy in opposite styles of play and an unsmiling nine-year-old chess automaton nemesis raised by an unscrupulous grandmaster and you have the makings of perhaps the best movie about a childhood devoted to competition. the film is punctuated by elegiac ruminations about bobby fischer, the brilliant and eccentric american world champion (also a prodigy) who, at the time of the film's release had been abroad and unheard from for almost 20 years. hoop dreams (dir. steve james, 1994, 171 minutes, documentary) gv884 .a1 h66 2005 this is without doubt one of the greatest and most human of all documentaries. the people and events in it are 100% real, but you wouldn't have gotten a more surprising or rewarding narrative if you'd tasked a hollywood screenwriter to come up with it. spanning five years, hoop dreams follows arthur agee and william gates, two young african-american basketball prospects from chicago, as they're aggressively recruited by a mostly white suburban catholic high school, and stays with them as they cope with the an unfamiliar school setting, the constant pressure to perform on the court, and the trials of an inner-city life of poverty. spending such an extended period of time with their subjects granted the filmmakers a familiarity that allowed for remarkable on-camera ease and candor from the players, their families, and coaches. you're granted insight into the ruthless and exploitative world of elite high school athletics, the healing power of family in the face of tremendous strife, and the manner in which both success and failure can find us in the least expected of ways. at the end of the film, having seen arthur and william mature from boys with wide-eyed hopes of the nba to young men with equal amounts of pain and triumph in their pasts, you feel as if you've grown up with them. if you only ever watch one documentary on sports, make it this one - it's so much more than that. the foot fist way (dir. jody hill, 2006, 85 minutes) pn1997.2 .f668 2008 sensei fred simmons (danny mcbride of eastbound and down and pineapple express ) is rude, dimwitted, egotistical and fantastically insecure. he's also a relentlessly compelling character. it's impossible to not be fascinated as he bumbles his way through a shaky marriage and his job as an instructor at an all-ages tae kwon do academy in a suburban strip mall, managing to pretty much always say the wrong thing and look incompetent. though he violates them in almost every word and action fred sincerely believes in the principles of honor and character that are intrinsic to tae kwon do. you end up wondering if someone like this could actually survive in the world, and that's just in the first twenty minutes. when fred's zen-creepy best friend and fellow sensei shows up for a road trip to see their favorite low-budget martial arts movie star the cringe inducing comedy kicks into overdrive. shaolin soccer (dir. stephen chow, 2001, 113 mins, in cantonese or english dub) pn1993.5 .c4 s33 2004 yeah, this movie has about as much to do with actual physics-bound soccer as the wwe has to do with ncaa wrestling. but just like vince mcmahon's stylized gladiator-theater shaolin soccer is loud, quirky and thoroughly entertaining. it's best not to get too hung up on the plot here, but the short version is that a wandering shaolin master and his equally talented brother monks get recruited by an aged and fallen soccer star to take to the pitch against a team of evil opponents (conveniently named team evil) in the inevitable \"big match\" at the end of the film. head-on performances, inspired slapstick and ridiculous visuals make this one of the funniest (if less subtle) sports comedies to come out in the last decade. this is pretty much what happens when you mix rocky , the bad news bears and crouching tiger, hidden dragon together. touching the void (dir. kevin macdonald, 2003, 107 minutes documentary) gv199.92 .s57 a3 2004 you might go your entire life and never see a better film about mountain climbing. in 1985 two friends attempted to climb the unconquered west face of siula grande in peru. they made it to the top well enough, but their descent was hampered by foul weather and food shortages... and then one of them shattered his leg in a fall. this a documentary that examines real events and has the full participation of the people who experienced them, but which also features stunning reenactments by actors and stunt double climbers. you won't look away. at bottom, touching the void is a movie about really, really, really wanting to live. it's hard to remember another film that features someone who, against such soul-crushing odds, decides to push through pain, isolation and a brutally inhospitable landscape in an effort to survive. a classic of the 2000s. wes hazard , media services assistant, o'neill library ask a librarian 24/7 | research help by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle":

in the o\u2019neill library in january of her first year on campus and then combined that job with a resident assistant position on the newton campus when she was a junior. now as she enters her senior year, she has learned to successfully juggle her studies with two jobs. during the day you may find gwen anywhere in the o\u2019neill library. her stacks maintenance responsibilities take her throughout the library, shelving books and generally keeping the library collections in good shape. she is indispensable behind the counter in the document services center on the main floor of the library as well. over the last three years, she has learned to provide all types of imaging services to a wide range of users. gwen especially enjoys the contact with library users both the areas she works in provide, but she also likes being immersed in the library environment. resident assistants are full-time students who live in the residence halls. gwen works and lives in the keyes south dormitory on the newton campus where she provides guidance, support and coordination of educational and social programs for approximately 33 freshmen women each year. as a senior, gwen will be a valuable resource for the new students living in keyes south. when graduation comes around, gwen will be headed to work or graduate school \u2013 she is still deciding what path to take. in the back

study success fall 2007 bapst 24/5 study a success according to student survey last spring over 800 students responded to a survey regarding the 24 hour study space in the bapst library. although the survey was intended to gauge the usage of a particular library, many interesting facts emerged regarding the study habits of graduate and undergraduate students at boston college. more than half the students responding to the survey indicated that they had taken advantage of the extended hours in gargan hall - 24 hour study that became available by strong student initiative in october 2006. over 17 % reported studying in gargan hall more than once a week and 55% had tried gargan hall just once. off campus undergrads use the space almost as much as on campus undergraduates. in fact studying in one of the libraries was reported as the preferred study venue, followed by resident hall rooms. the survey revealed that very few students preferred to use a caf\u00e9 or dining hall for studying, but the availability of drinks/coffee and food/snacks was the second and third most important service/amenity for effective study. the most important service/amenity was internet access and a power source for laptops. about a quarter of the students surveyed were unaware of the 24 hour study in bapst. however, those that did study in gargan hall, cited the main reasons for being there as the quiet atmosphere and the ability to eat snacks. students commented that gargan hall is the best place to find quiet late at night. others said that the study lounges can be cramped and loud, so bapst has been great to go to. the majority of students polled said that bapst really serves a great need at bc. adeane bregman, head librarian, bapst art library who's my subject specialist | ask a

happening? spring 2011 meet estelle by estelle baik working at o'neill library for three years has been like the movie inception , entering the levels of a \"dream within a dream\" in order to access the target's subconscious mind and extract information. my first level of dream began when i was a freshman. i followed the boston college libraries' application process without luck. everybody knows library jobs are hard to get because so many students apply for them. believing i would be jobless, i consulted a friend about working elsewhere. however, my friend happened to be working at o'neill library and introduced me to his boss. there i met my first target, paul bridden, the daytime supervisor in the access services department. with a little bit of luck and a prayer, i was hired and entered the first level of o'neill's dream - the main floor on level 3. my daily adventures consisted of traveling extensively across the shelves of books, magazines, journals, etc. making sure that everything was in order and shelved properly. sometimes, paul assigned special duties like sitting at a computer and making lists of books with their call numbers. at other times, i was assigned to scan documents from books for professors' classes. after a year of extracting information and skill on the main floor, i entered a different layer of the dream. estelle baik photo by kevin tringale my second level of dream was working during the o'neill library's nightshift and entering the world of jeff kohl, the night time manager. it was an interesting adventure working the evening shifts with jeff, dallas burkhardt, and kevin saffo. my prime task was to sit at the computer, next to the printers, and make sure that the printer stations worked properly and paper did not run out. evening shifts were interesting. towards the end of the semester, i witnessed a student running around the library with only a pair of speedos on! of course the security guard had him leave the building, but do you think that would have happen during the daytime? oh, i miss the evening shifts. after being m.i.a. for a semester studying abroad in russia, i came back to o'neill's third level of the dream to work in the government documents/microforms department under kevin tringale, my current supervisor. my daily routine consists of checking the interlibrary loan (ill ) e-mails looking for articles that need to be scanned from the microform collection, re-shelving materials after they have been used, and making sure that any new government documents in print are properly processed, labeled and shelved. sometimes while shelving government documents i get distracted and stop to read the contents of the document. the latest title that i found fascinating was \"china's exchange rate policy and trade imbalances\". as a slavic studies major who is interested in far eastern russia, i cannot help myself but to read a little bit about china. will china's trade imbalance affect russia's foreign economic policy in the east? i cannot believe that some students graduate from bc without taking advantage of the government documents/microforms department. perhaps majors in political science or history come often because information about past events is easily found here! for instance, on microfilm the new york times goes as far back as 1851 and the boston globe to 1872! the end of second semester is almost here and i have no idea how \"inception\" will take me further. since freshman year at bc i have been working in o'neill library, each year in a different department. the question is, how am i going to get out of the o'neill library's dream? will i survive? where will i end up? who knows? i still have another year to figure it out before facing reality. estelle baik , arts and

the statement released by the art club regarding the show, \"the concept behind the mind often wanders was to create a 'dream space' out of what is normally regarded as a sterile 'think space' - a library. the art club wanted students to be reminded of the fact that intellectual stimulation need not negate the wandering of the mind. we sought to create a space to contemplate, to dream, to allow the mind to wander. ours is a space where curiosity roams free.\" with each successive exhibition, the interest and recognition of the level one gallery is growing. the boston college libraries have

good math now - one and a half times 100 is 150. survival for a sesqui-century is not to be taken lightly. most colleges founded in the united states in the 19th century are no longer with us. many others have changed names, so it is unusual that boston college has retained its original designation - though there is some confusion with a local institution with a similar name. the beginnings of boston college were not auspicious: a delay of twenty years between the first proposal and the opening of the doors; a high time of anti-catholic sentiment and activity from the american (aka know nothing) party; reliance on contributions from an impoverished irish immigrant community; effects of the current civil war; and the eagle had not yet been selected as the school's symbol. but we survived and indeed prospered. the official celebration period, from may 2012 to october 2013, will be filled with acknowledgement of an uncertain start, description of the present status of the descendents of those early irish immigrants, assessment of boston college as it is, and planning for increasing excellence. there is not as much buzz about the centennial part of the 100/150 observance, but the move here resembled in some ways the earlier challenges: boldness in choosing a site and an architect; delay in plans and funding; unevenness in enrollments. shocking as it may seem, the first building, called the recitation building, later tower hall, and later still gasson hall, was completed behind schedule and over budget. class of 1913 entering chestnut hill campus the delays made the opening of the building all the more exciting. fortunately we have a photo of the students first coming to see the new building. on march 28, 1913, members of the senior class traveled from boston on the trolley and walked up the hill on commonwealth avenue. evidently the president and faculty had taken an earlier trolley, because they were waiting to greet the men, welcome them to the campus, and show them around the new building. fortunately, the students produced the first yearbook that year (called sub turri , \"under the tower\") so we have pictures of all the seniors. it will be fun to put names to the students arriving with such energy for their first look at the long-awaited building. they finished their senior year at the buildings in the south end, but they held their commencement exercises on university heights. david horn , head librarian of archives and manuscripts, burns library ask a librarian 24/7 | research help by subject bc libraries home | ugrads@bc.library review board | past issues", "hrefTitle": "150Th", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/libraries/ugradsnewsletter/2010fall/index.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Kinesiology and Sports"], "title": "University Libraries -

(class of 1936) has left to the university. the late speaker of the united states house of representatives (known to his friends and colleagues as \"tip\") has had a library, a scholarship fund and an endowed faculty position named after him. he even donated his political papers to the boston college library. o'neill never forgot his alma mater and contributed his own time and energy to aid boston college in its development activities, helping to make the institution grow from a small liberal arts college into one of the nation's preeminent research and teaching universities. o'neill is pictured here in the procession line of the 1981 university commencement. he received the ignatian medal and was the keynote speaker that year. despite o'neill's many contributions both to boston college and the nation as a whole, his achievements are in danger of fading from popular memory. for instance, today's undergraduates are unlikely to remember o'neill in public office, as they were barely in elementary school when he retired from political life in 1986. years after his graduation from boston college, o'neill remained fond of his alma mater and his alma mater celebrated his achievements. this sentiment is evident in the photograph reproduced here. the image shows a sign at alumni stadium welcoming o'neill to the campus for the 1981 commencement. riding on the wave of excitement generated by the recent publication of john aloysius farrell's tip o'neill and the democratic century (boston: little, brown & co., 2001), this exhibit hopes to inform and remind people of o'neill's legacy as a boston college student and alumnus. the exhibit uses images and other materials found in the thomas p. o'neill papers and university archives housed in the burns library. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Thomas P.

original novels | short stories/folklore | british authors | irish writers | american & european writers | conclusion the irish free state established by the anglo-irish treaty (1921) following the war of independence (1919-1921) pursued a project of cultural nationalism which among other aims focused on reviving the irish language. the cumann na ngaedheal government established an g\u00fam , the publications branch of the department of education (later oifig an tsol\u00e1thair/the state publishing agency) in 1925-1926 to supply textbooks and fiction in irish for the educational and recreation needs of the newly independent ireland. an g\u00fam , to fulfil its publishing mandate, cultivated both original authors and translators. in addition to organizing literary competitions for original novels, plays and short stories in irish such as m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 siochfhradha's collection of short stories soineann's doineann , it commissioned translations of european and american authors, such as iain \u00e1luinn , a 1931 translation of neil munro's novel of the scottish highlands john splendid (1898). in addition to rendering foreign authors in irish, an g\u00fam also translated english language texts by irish authors such as m\u00edche\u00e1l \u00f3 flainn's translation of d\u00f3mhnaill \u00f3 corcordha/daniel corkery's the threshold of quiet in 1931 as log

dublin, town house, 1994). in an effort to expand our understanding of the free state, this virtual exhibition displays dust jackets that accompanied an g\u00fam publications and reclaims this \"lost\" art. this exhibit consists of an g\u00fam covers recently acquired by the john j. burns library of boston college as a gift from john w. o'gorman (class of 1953). the o'gorman gift includes the library of the goody glover gaelic society library that promoted irish language and dancing in boston in the 1950s and conducted classes at a private house in joy street on beacon hill. the dust jackets displayed here are from the irish collection of the burns library and from private collections in the boston area. prepared by brian \u00f3 conchubhair. acknowledgements: philip o'leary, mike

development of the university mascot introduction: importance of a mascot though use of mascots goes back to ancient history, the word \"mascot\" did not come into usage in the english language until the late 19th century. a french composer named edmond audran (1842-1901) wrote a popular operetta entitled \"la mascotte\" (1880). it was quickly translated in english and performed in london in 1881 and in boston in 1882. the plot was very light-hearted fare concerning a rural girl who brought good luck to whoever possessed her, provided that she remained uncorrupted. the term, translated into english as \"mascot\" and used as a noun, has a notion of a person, animal or thing that brings good luck. it quickly became employed by sports teams. besides serving as a good luck charm, a mascot also provides a school with an added sense of identity. in 1889, yale university became the first american university to adopt a mascot, a bulldog named \"handsome dan.\" prior to 1921, boston college did not have an official mascot. between 1905-1910, the student body began voicing the desirability of having a mascot. briefly, they toyed with the idea of using the owl as mascot, but this never caught on. 1920 was a year of great success for the track team and certain students suggested the antelope. however, the enthusiasm for this choice soon lagged as well. then, as goes the college lore, a certain \"old man\" suggested the eagle and the rest is history. this online exhibit looks at the efforts to establish the eagle as the boston college mascot. it includes different artistic interpretations, as well as the eagle's continuing role and use in university life. used with the permission of the howard gotlieb archival research center at boston university. in this photograph dated january 12, 1977, longtime athletic director william j. flynn (1939; m.ed.,1940) paints the university logo, which includes an image of the eagle, onto the gymnasium floor, a most prominent

boston college ever to excel thomas p. o'neill, jr. and boston college virtual exhibit spring 2002 - burns library introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion thomas p. o'neill learned two great lessons from his first campaign. one lesson was learned on the last day of the campaign from his high school elocution and drama teacher, a neighbor who lived across the street from his residence. on that fateful day, mrs. elizabeth o'brien approached the aspiring politician and said \"tom, i'm going to vote for you tomorrow even though you didn't ask me.\" o'neill was puzzled as he had known mrs. o'brien for years and had done chores for her, cutting grass, raking leaves and shoveling snow. he told his neighbor that \"i didn't think i had to ask for your vote.\" she replied \"tom, let me tell you something: people like to be asked.\" the second bit of advice came a few days after the election from o'neill's father. during the election, thomas o'neill, sr., removed himself from his son's first election and left him to his own devices. however, after the election, he told tip: \"let me tell you something that i learned years ago. all politics is local.\" during the campaign, tip took his neighborhood for granted and did not work hard enough in his \"own backyard.\" o'neill took these lessons to heart. he would not hold his career aspirations over the interests of his constituents. the advice paid off: o'neill served for fifty years in public office (sixteen years in the massachusetts house of representations and thirty-four years in the united states house of representatives). in 1937, o'neill began his first year of public life as a massachusetts state representative. he ran on bread and butter issues: more jobs and decent wages. o'neill pursued wpa funds for the creation of local jobs to cleanup the polluted charles river and alewife brook. in that same year, he took an unpopular stand and voted to repeal an american legion-backed loyalty oath that would have been required of all educators (including college professors). o'neill felt that the oath cast doubts upon the patriotism of educators and was \"an insult to some of the finest men and women i had ever known.\" though the american legion vowed to defeat o'neill in his next election, o'neill explained his position to his constituents and was reelected to a second term. his stand established him as an independent-minded legislator. his hard work and integrity continued to get him reelected. o'neill also earned the respect of his follow democratic representatives and was elected minority leader in 1947 by his peers. the above is an image of a campaign card used in o'neill's 1940 campaign. in 1948, u.s. congressman john mccormack (democratic party whip and leader of the massachusetts delegation) offered his support and encouraged o'neill to campaign hard to make the democratic party the majority party in the massachusetts house of representatives for the first time in a century. their effort paid off as they captured 38 out of 40 gop districts targeted by the democratic strategy. the democrats now held a majority of the seats (122 to 118). o'neill became the speaker of the massachusetts house of representatives. in 1952, congressman john f. kennedy ran for u.s. senate and this left his congressional seat open. o'neill decided to run, and won the election by a three thousand vote margin. in 1952, o'neill was riding against the political current as the republicans gained ground on the democratic party across the country. adlai stevenson was defeated by general dwight eisenhower in the race for the white house and the republicans captured congress. o'neill had gone from the massachusetts house speakership (one of the most powerful government positions in massachusetts) to being a freshman congressman of the minority party. he is pictured here arriving at the capitol with his friend and colleague congressman edward boland (bc class of 1926). for twenty years, boland and o'neill shared an apartment in washington, d.c. thomas o'neill did not take any vote for granted. he is pictured to the left at the ballot box with his wife mildred ann (miller) o'neill in the mid 1950s. not forgetting the advice of mrs. o'brien, on every election, he would ask millie for her vote. she would typically reply \"tom, i'll give you every consideration.\" mildred miller and o'neill had been married in 1941 at st. john's church in north cambridge. over the years, o'neill always stated how grateful he was for all of the support that millie gave him and their family of five children. in 1938, o'neill supplemented his salary by establishing a local real estate business and would stay in business until 1971. unlike other congressmen's families, o'neill's family stayed in cambridge while o'neill was in washington. he returned home to his family on weekends. listing all of o'neill's accomplishments in congress would be a daunting task and space only allows the listing a few highlights. in 1955, he became a member of the influential house rules committee. it was just one of the many committees that o'neill served on during his years in congress. in 1958, o'neill and edward boland introduced legislation that lead to the establishment of the cape cod national seashore. in 1970, he was a co-sponsor of a reform bill that ended the practice of unrecorded voting in the house. congressmen would now be accountable to their constituents for their actions. in 1971, o'neill became the majority whip and was now part of the house leadership. two years later, he became the majority leader. the majority leader is shown here (right) serving on a congressional committee in a photograph taken by house photographer dev o'neill (no relation to tip) in 1973. in 1974, o'neill played a key role in managing the nixon impeachment proceedings. in 1977, o'neill became the speaker of the house of representatives. he held the position until 1987. this was the longest continuous term of the speakership in the nation's history. one of his most important actions in congress was to open the house to live television coverage (cspan) beginning in 1979. in the 1980s, o'neill spearheaded the democrats' efforts to hold the excesses of the reagan revolution in check and to prevent massive scale backs of social programs for the nation's aged and less advantaged citizens. the speaker felt reagan did not have a firm grasp on domestic affairs and once characterized the popular president as a \"herbert hoover with a smile.\" for these efforts, o'neill was vilified as a \"tax and spend liberal\" by the republicans, the conservative press and even some of his own constituents. also to the displeasure of the reagan administration, he was horrified by the atrocities committed by contra rebels in nicaragua and sought to limit u.s. funding to these groups. o'neill did not run for reelection in 1986 and retired from public office in january 1987. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Speaker", "refURL":

there were only 2649 full and part-time students enrolled in 1935-1936 school year. in a 1991 interview, o'neill recalled that \"the school was small, and everybody knew each other...everything was walk-on, you know, there were no dorms. actually, we were only in three buildings. st. mary's hall was the chapel...everyone loved it-it was small, it was intimate, it was chummy.\" o'neill faced a challenging and rigorous education (a classical curriculum with required coursework in greek, latin, mathematics, history, english, and theology that left little room for electives). however, he found time for extracurricular activities and was a member of the sodality, von pastor historical society, and the law academy. during his senior year, o'neill was elected sergeant at arms of this organization. he also rowed and captained the crew team and was a member of the fencing team. o'neill's most significant extracurricular activity took place outside of the classroom: he ran for a seat on the cambridge city council. of the forty-eight candidates running for eight seats, o'neill finished ninth, not bad for a college senior. it was the only election that he ever lost. football was a big part of boston college life during the thirties and fordham university was the team to beat. in 1933 and 1935, o'neill's sophomore and senior years, boston college students traveled to new york in great numbers to watch the contest. o'neill and his buddies drove to new york in his old ford convertible. alas, boston college lost 32 to 6. however, the boys had fun throwing water bags out of their hotel in times square until the hotel detective ordered them to stop or be kicked out. his senior yearbook reported that the 1933 fordham trip was the \"most memorable incident in o'neill's college career\" and \"he was one of the most prominent (vociferously) members of the boston college club of cambridge.\" in 1935, o'neill and his friends again journeyed to new york city. the excitement of the game is captured in a detail of the heights (the boston college student paper) to the left. alas, boston college lost again; this time the score was 19 to 0. the postgame hi-jinks of 1933 graduated to the more sophisticated activity of listening to the eddy duchin orchestra at the plaza hotel. thomas o'neill and two hundred forty-eight other undergraduates finished the necessary requirements and graduated on wednesday, june 10, 1936 at four o'clock in the afternoon. the cover of his commencement program is reproduced to the left. the hon. michael macwhite, ireland's \"envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\" gave the keynote address and was awarded a honorary doctor of laws. his senior class voted o'neill \"class politician\" and \"class caveman.\" the yearbook reported that he planned to \"keep active in politics until he is mayor of cambridge.\" the editors also noted that o'neill was barely defeated in his election and he was \"more confident of success in the next.\" little did they know, the next election was just around the corner. photo credits: university archives, burns library, boston college introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Student", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Thomas P.

boston college ever to excel thomas p. o'neill, jr. and boston college virtual exhibit spring 2002 - burns library introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion throughout the years, boston college has recognized the achievements of thomas p. o'neill, jr. the university bestowed upon o'neill numerous awards and honors. his legacy lives on to this day. a library, an endowed position in the political science department, a scholarship and an award for distinguished citizenship all bear his name. this section highlights several of these honors. on may 13, 1964, o'neill was honored as the year's outstanding alumnus by the boston college alumni club of washington, d.c. president reverend michael p. walsh, s.j. is shown here presenting the award to o'neill. the congressman had also received the alumni association's william v. mckenna medal earlier that year. photo credit: university archives, burns library, boston college at the 1973 university commencement, o'neill received an honorary law degree. he is shown here at the ceremonies standing next to father monan. in the late 1930s, while a state representative, o'neill had enrolled in the boston college law school. however, the pressures of simultaneously going to school and being an elected official left very little time for serious study. according to o'neill biographer farrell, he and follow state legislator edward boland were both \"booted out\" of the law school when the dean decided to raise the academic standards. the incident bothered o'neill for years to come. receiving an honorary law degree must have given him a sense of vindication. photo credit: university archives, burns library, boston college on december 9, 1979, boston college held a birthday dinner fundraiser to raise 1.2 million dollars for the thomas p. o'neill, jr. endowed chair in political science. it was o'neill's sixty-seventh birthday. besides o'neill, the main guest of honor was president jimmy carter. as evident in the photograph to the left, the speaker had a friendly relationship with the president. after all, carter was the only democratic party president that he ever worked with while serving in the house leadership (majority whip, majority leader, speaker). carter's presence gave quite a boost to this fundraising event. president carter, j. peter grace, edward kennedy, and j. donald monan, s.j. gave tributes to the speaker. o'neill always held educators in high regard. he once remarked that \"educators have a premier responsibility to help our young people ponder whether their individual actions will benefit their family and friends, and urge them to be concerned about improving their neighborhood, their community, their nation, and their world.\" an endowed chair named in his honor is a fitting living monument to a man who held education in such high regard. photo credit: thomas p. o'neill papers, burns library, boston college o'neill was the keynote speaker for the 1981 commencement. he also received the ignatius medal as part of the ceremonies. the speaker is shown here receiving the medal from president father monan. the award recognizes individuals whose lives reflect the contributions made by st. ignatius loyola to catholic spirituality and education and who apply these values to modern professional life. in his commencement address, o'neill was well aware of the significance of this award and remarked: \"i am truly honored to receive this medal from my alma mater because i genuinely appreciate what jesuit expectations are in the religious as well as the secular life. this is a very special honor.\" the undergraduate government of boston college also presented o'neill with a reward recognizing \"his consistent and effective efforts to open roads for government to play a part in assisting students to carry out their aspirations for higher education.\" photo credit: jet photography, university archives, burns library, boston college groundbreaking and construction work began on the thomas p. o'neill jr. library on october 18 1981. on october 14, 1984, the library was dedicated with o'neill in attendance. the photograph here shows o'neill and the other dignitaries present at the dedication. o'neill commented that he had \"declined many offers to name buildings after me...but this time i made an exception because this college has meant so much to me, to my family, to my community. i am proud of its past and i am proud to pay a part in its future.\" most students, staff and faculty will use the library at some point in their careers at boston college and, by doing so, they will encounter the legacy of thomas p. o'neill, jr. photo credit: office of communications, university archives, burns library, boston college from 1987 to1996, boston college recreated the speaker's office in the bapst library. the original exhibit is pictured here. the room had originally housed the library director's office (and presently houses the university chancellor's office). on loan from the government was a desk used by president grover cleveland (used by o'neill in his washington office), a grandfather clock, curtains, two chandeliers, a sofa, a love seat, chairs, tables, lamps and a porcelain horse sculpture given to the speaker by the premier of china. in 1999, the exhibit was refashioned and permanently installed on the second floor of the o'neill library. photo credit: office of communications, university archives, burns library, boston college thomas p' o'neill, jr. is pictured here with the o'neill scholarship recipients in may 1990. it is a fitting legacy to have this scholarship named after him. in 1986, o'neill remarked that \"yet even today there is a need to ensure that boston college remains true to its long tradition of educating the sons and daughters of the working class...pursuing a degree at boston college takes more than time and talent, it takes a lot of money...even with federal and state assistance many young people cannot afford the cost of four years of study. at boston college, the thomas p. o'neill, jr. scholarship fund will solve that problem for some deserving but financially disadvantaged youths. hopefully, it will also help guarantee that a proud tradition of boston college's past will be a continuing part of boston college's future.\" to this day, students from o'neill's congressional district receive this scholarship and are able to attend boston college. photo credit: gary gilbert, thomas p. o'neill papers,

(1874-1953), was a mason and spent much of his life involved with local city politics. o'neill, sr. was also active with the local democratic party, his union, the cambridge elks lodge and the knights of columbus. tip's mother, rose, died while he was still an infant. on her deathbed, rose made her husband vow to keep the family together and not divide children up among different aunts and uncles. tip, his older brother william and his sister mary rose were watched over by rose le blanc, the family's french-canadian housekeeper, extended family members and the dominican nuns of the local st. john convent. tip's father moved the family from fairfield street to a two-family house located at 74 orchard street. the building is pictured here in a photograph taken in 1973. it was a nicer neighborhood and the house was comfortable. the o'neill family occupied the top two floors and rented out the first level. o'neill biographer john farrell described the community as having the feeling of a \"small prosperous midwestern city during the 1920s\" with a \"wide central avenue, tree-lined streets and a sampling of handsome architecture.\" in his autobiography, tip o'neill described his community as \"relatively well off by working-class standards, but you didn't have to go far to find pockets of real poverty.\" 74 orchard remained his official residence until his marriage to mildred miller in 1941. they remained in the neighborhood, moving to nearby 16 norris street. the three milestones of o'neill's catholic boyhood, as indicated by farrell, were first communion, confirmation and moving from st. john's grammar school into st. john's high school in cambridge. the high school is pictured here in a photograph taken in 1980. in his autobiography, o'neill admitted that he wasn't the greatest student. however, a nun recalled his ability on the debate team and said that he could \"talk you deaf, dumb and blind.\" he was a likeable fellow who occasionally played hooky. the yearbook made the following comment of o'neill: \"never worried, never vexed, in one day and out the next.\" much of his time was spent with the \"barry's corner gang\" of friends. his pals rented space from \"old man barry\" and essentially had a private clubhouse. many of the gang would remain lifelong friends, and still held reunions into the 1980s. o'neill spent much of youthful leisure time playing and watching athletics. he enjoyed playing baseball, football, golf and basketball, and earned money as a caddy at the arlmont country club. in high school, o'neill was the captain of the basketball team during his senior year. in the photograph of this team, o'neill is seated in the middle of the center row. sports provided the source of his well known nickname, \"tip.\" the first \"tip o'neill\" was james edward o'neill, one of baseball's greatest batters, who played with the st. louis browns in the 1880's. he earned the nickname \"tip\" because of an uncanny ability to foul off pitches until he drew a walk or a soft throw from a pitcher. many boys had the nickname \"tip.\" both o'neill brothers as children had \"tip\" as a nickname. originally, bill was known as \"tip\" and tom as \"little tip.\" however, the name stuck with tom throughout his life. photo credits: r. cheek photograph. cambridge historical commission office of communications, university archives, burns library, boston college thomas p. o'neill papers, burns library, boston college introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Background", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "Thomas P.

and we ask your continuous blessing on him and upon this revered body that he loves so dearly. amen.\" the tone was set for the evening's later celebration. later that day, 2300 people attended a $1000-per-plate gala reception in honor of o'neill's fifty years of public service hosted by boston college at the washington hilton. in a detail of a photograph, o'neill is pictured at the event surrounded by happy friends and colleagues. o'neill was given tributes by j. donald monan, s.j., senator ted kennedy, irish prime minister garret fitzgerald, comedian bob hope, former president gerald ford and president ronald reagan. monan remarked that \"speaker o'neill could have authorized a salute to his years in a dozen ways without any involvement of boston college. the fact that he wanted much of the splendor of his own career to reflect upon his alma mater is characteristic of him, and gives a clue to why people so enjoyed celebrating his career.\" the event raised two million dollars for the thomas p. o'neill, jr. scholarship fund. the scholarship is designed to aid less advantaged youths in the boston area who without financial assistance could not otherwise attend boston college. in may 1986, thomas o'neill returned to boston college to take part in the class of 1936's fiftieth anniversary. in the photograph on the left, o'neill is seen joyfully taking in the reunion festivities along with father monan, an unidentified alum, alumni association president sheila mcgovern, and classmate robert o'hayre. in 1987, o'neill honored his alma mater even further by donating his congressional papers to boston college's john j. burns library of rare books and special collections. introduction | background | student | speaker | alumnus | honors | conclusion", "hrefTitle": "Alumnus", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/oneill.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Kinesiology and Sports"], "title": "Teams of Destiny", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/teams/5.html", "text": "teams of destiny skip to main content boston college ever to excel teams of destiny virtual exhibit fall 2001 - burns library introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940 the 1940 team is perhaps the greatest football team in the history of boston college. expectations ran high in 1940, after the previous year's team earned the school's first appearance in a bowl game (boston college lost to clemson in the cotton bowl). the 1940 team became known as the \"team of destiny.\" in his second year at boston college, coach frank leahy had a team of great talent. charlie o'rourke was the quarterback and his backs included veterans frank maznicki, lou montgomery (boston college's first african-american football player), and captain henry toczylowski. they were joined by a talented newcomer named mike holovak. the team also had wonderful receivers including henry woronicz, gene goodreault, ed zabilski and don currivan. the team was undefeated outscoring its opponents 320 to 52 and held six teams scoreless. boston college impressed the sports community by defeating tulane university (considered the second best team in the nation) 27 to 7 in the second week of the season and defeating georgetown 19 to 18 (snapping georgetown's streak of twenty-two consecutive wins). on january 1, 1941, boston college defeated tennessee in the sugar bowl 19 to 13. the eagles earned a number five ranking in the 1940 ap national poll and laid claim to the national championship. the sugar bowl squad (from left to right). bottom row: gene goodreault, john yauckos, george kerr, chester gladchuck;

director's files, burns library, boston college the records from father sweeney's tenure as the director of humanities series are presently part of the burns library's manuscripts department and serve the obvious role of a resource for biographers studying the individuals who spoke at boston college. these materials, while not an exclusive source of information, are important in studying the activities of many literary figures. for instance, as illustrated here, the collection includes a handful of letters written by jack kerouac as well as copies of sweeney's outgoing correspondence. though kerouac never lectured at boston college, the letters reveal that the \"beat\" writer did consider asking sweeney to \"formalize\" his civil marriage to stella stampas but he changed his mind and never wrote sweeney again. the humanities series records preserve the history of the lecture series for future scholars and serve as a most appropriate memorial to sweeney's achievements during fifty years of service to boston college. the collection is open to researchers but the library encourages interested persons to contact the reference staff prior to a visit. introduction | background

herbert treat. this is a photograph-postcard of alumni field in the early 1920s. after the move to chestnut hill, games were originally played on a municipally owned field next to the chestnut hill reservoir. funded primarily with alumni contributions, alumni field was dedicated on october 20, 1915 and was used for football, baseball and track. it had a limited seating capacity of only 5000. to accommodate larger crowds, football games were also played in local stadiums such as fenway park and braves field. pictured here is coach frank w. cavanaugh who coached at boston college from 1919 to 1926. from 1911 to 1916, he had successfully coached dartmouth college and then served in the united states army during world war i. cavanaugh was severely injured by shrapnel and earned the nickname of the \"iron major.\" sports historian jack falla characterized his boston college teams as being \"aggressive-some said intimidating-and exceptionally well conditioned.\" his teams at boston college had a combined record of 48-14-5. cavanaugh left boston college to coach at fordham university. his teams at fordham also had a reputation for strong defense and the front line became known as the \"seven blocks of granite.\" he died just prior to the start of the 1938 season. in 1943, he was made the subject of a hollywood movie, starring pat o'brien, called \"the iron major.\" cavanaugh was inducted into the national football foundation & college hall of fame in 1954 and into the boston college hall of fame in 1970. jimmy \"fitzy\" fitzpatrick (class of 1921) was a speedy half-back with multiple talents. he could pass left or right-handed, had a career punting average of sixty-five yards and possessed a long-range for his drop kick field goals. fitzpatrick was elected team captain in 1919, but when invited to be captain again in 1920 he modestly refused, allowing his friend luke urban to be unanimously chosen. his football career came to an end after his shoulder was broken in the november 1920 game against georgetown. he was the team's scoring leader in the 1916, 1917, and 1919 seasons. in 1921, cavanaugh praised him as \"the greatest athlete boston college has ever had...i doubt that any has ever done more for his college in athletics than fitzy has done for boston college.\" fitzpatrick was inducted into boston college's hall of fame in 1970. boston college proved itself to be a team of national distinction by deafeating the heavily favored squads from yale university in both 1919 and 1920. in 1919, boston college won by a score of 5 to 3. jimmy fitzpatrick's greatest moment came in the 1919 game against yale when he drop-kicked a game winning forty-seven yard field goal with only two minutes left to play. for years to come, alumni referred to this play as \"the kick.\" in 1920, they won 21 to 13. this cartoon appeared on the front cover of the october 13, 1920 issue of the heights (boston college's student newspaper). the image shows luke urban training the yale bulldog. this is the cover of a development brochure produced for the 1921 boston college building campaign. the 1920 eastern champions are figured prominently in the brochure indicating the growing importance of athletics for the university's external visibility and fundraising efforts. the eagle was adopted as the college mascot in early 1920 and quickly became a prominent symbol of boston college. the 1920 team had the proud distinction to be the first team officially called the \"eagles.\" introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940", "hrefTitle": "1920",

their games and outscored their opponents 263 to 39. the team included many athletes recruited by former coach frank cavanaugh, including quarterback al weston, half-back patrick creedon, all-american end charlie murphy and captain warren mcguirk. memorable games included a 6 to 0 upset over navy, a 60 to 6 pounding of manhattan college, a 24 to 0 victory over a luke urban-coached canisius college,

1928 coaching staff. from left to right: william ormsby; william kelleher; joseph mckenney and john mcmanmon. head coach mckenney (class of 1927), as a student, was the eagle's 1926 team captain and a co-all-eastern quarterback. in 1928, at the age of twenty-three, he became boston college's coach. during his seven years, his teams had a combined record of 44 wins 17 loss and 4 ties. mckenney later served as an official for both college football and national football league games. he also presided over a hastily organized fundraising campaign for a new boston college stadium in 1957 and this remains one of his most important contributions to boston college. he was named to the boston college hall of fame in 1970, the professional football hall of fame in 1983, and the national football foundation & college hall of fame in 1988. he died in 1995. this is a photograph of captain warren mcguirk (class of 1929). one of his greatest sports moments came in the 1927 game against holy cross when he recovered the ball after a blocked punt and ran in the game-winning touchdown. mcguirk would later be the university of massachusetts' dean of the school of physical education and director of athletics for over three decades. he was inducted into the boston college hall of fame in 1970. pictured here is quarterback al weston (class of 1929). weston was considered one of the greatest running quarterbacks of his day. he was also captain of the baseball team and the first baseman. one of weston's greatest football moments came in 1928 when ran in the game winning touchdown, and the game's only points, in the 6 to 0 upset over navy. he was the team's scoring leader in the 1926, 1927 and 1928 seasons. weston would later play professional baseball with the boston braves. he was inducted into the boston college hall of fame in 1970. shown here is the cover of the 1928 boston college - holy cross game program. boston college won this game 19 to 0 and cleared the last hurdle for the eastern championship. the annual game between boston college and holy cross was a historic rivalry between the two premier catholic colleges of new england. the feelings aroused by the annual match were somewhat akin to today's boston college - notre dame rivalry. the teams first played each other in 1896 and the games continued until 1986 when holy cross ended the series. boston college's record against holy cross is 48 wins, 31 losses and 3 ties. this is the cover of the dinner program held in celebration of boston college's second eastern championship. the banquet was held on january 8, 1929 at the elk's hotel. boston college had reason to take pride in the achievement's of joseph mckenney's team. the school's football program was achieving national recognition as one of strongest in new england. in the decade to come, as sports historian jack falla suggests, the next logical step would have been more intersectional matches and possible appearances in college bowl games. alas, the financial difficulties suffered at boston college during the great depression put these aspirations on hold for a decade. introduction | 1899 | 1920 | 1928 | 1940", "hrefTitle": "1928", "refURL":

we didn't make them stand at the end of a long receiving line for instance. those things really make a difference.\" father sweeney began lifelong friendships with many lecturers and many of their spouses. these friendships are documented in his lifelong correspondence with christopher dawson, veronica dawson, t.s. eliot, valerie eliot, alec guinness, seamus heaney, richard murphy, sean o'faolain, susan sontag, arnold toynbee and other individuals. photograph of actor sir alec guinness standing with historian christopher dawson at boston college-sponsored birthday party for dawson on november 8, 1959. a day later, guinness gave a reading entitled \"readings of christian verse and prose\" as part of the humanities series. photo credit: humanities series -

(\"the cost of an g\u00fam,\" irish independent, 24 january 1966. translation of \"costas an gh\u00faim\" which appeared in comhar, november, 1965.) the 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of independent publishing houses which focused on creative writing in irish. in response an g\u00fam began to focus increasingly on fiction for children and young adults, most notably thrillers, detective fiction and educational texts. foremost among the fiction for young adults were the novels of cathal \u00f3 sandair and miche\u00e1l d'and\u00fan. cathal \u00f3 s\u00e1ndair, one of the most prolific irish language authors, produced over one hundred novels, many of them westerns featuring cowboys and gun fights. born in weston super mare, england to an english father and irish mother, his family moved to ireland when he was a child. while still a school boy \u00f3 sandair published a story in the first issue of the magazine gael \u00f3g in 1938. his first novel appeared in 1943 and featured r\u00e9ics carl\u00f3, the most famous irish language detective. in addition to the many adventures of r\u00e9ics carl\u00f3, \u00f3 s\u00e1ndair wrote a series of novels featuring the character r\u00e9amonn \u00f3g. the third strand of his fiction centered on school adventures where boys and girls inevitably save the day. \u00f3 s\u00e1ndair is reputed to have published 160 books and sold more than 500,000 copies. title: r\u00e9amonn \u00f3g agus marcaigh na ho\u00edche (r\u00e9amonn \u00f3g and the night riders) published: 1957 author: cathal \u00f3 sandair (1922-1996) artwork: l.m.s. source: private collection title: tr\u00ed d\u00fanmharfa go leith (three and a half murders) published: 1956 author: m\u00edche\u00e1l d'and\u00fan artwork: unsigned source: private collection title: thiar i ngleann ceo (beyond in misty valley) published: 1953 author: tadhg \u00f3 rabhartaigh (1909-1982) artwork: unsigned source: private collection comment: \u00f3 rabhartaigh translated annie m.p. smithson's novel her irish heritage for an g\u00fam .", "hrefTitle": "Conclusion", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/bkcovers.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "Boston College Eagle - Virtual Exhibit", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/eagle/3.html", "text": "boston college eagle - virtual exhibit skip to main content boston college ever to excel boston college eagle virtual exhibit summer 2005 - burns library introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion mascot: live, stuffed and costumed in the fall of 1923, boston college was presented with a gift of a live eagle (it was actually a hawk). surviving a horrible storm, the exhausted bird landed on a fishing schooner fifty miles out from the coast of chatham, massachusetts. the ship, itself, had barely survived the storm. the bird became entangled in the ship's rigging and was rescued by the crew. having read of the school's recent adoption of the eagle as a mascot, they presented the bird as a gift to boston college. with a diet of buffalo meat and the tender care of father daniel lynch, sj, the bird soon regained its strength. alas, less than two weeks after arriving at the heights, the bird flew away on sunday morning prior to the game with marquette university. bc lost the game by one point. football captain charles darling is pictured with the \"eagle.\" in the spring of 1924, a bald eagle was captured on a new mexico ranch and sent to boston college by rev. john a. risacher, s.j. (a former teacher at boston college high school). this event received national attention as the bird was captured by a cowboy employed on the ranch of senator albert b. fall. the eagle was never officially named but became known to the students as \"herpy.\" a junior, in jest, had pointed out the relationship between a \"bald\" head and a certain remedy for hair loss known as \"herpicide.\" unfortunately, herpy was rather unhappy with his new home and tried to bite through his cage, resulting in an injured beak and other ailments. the eagle was sent to angell memorial hospital and upon his release given to the franklin park zoo. a snapshot of rev. john a. risacher, s.j. is reproduced here. with the loss of herpy, father risacher gave boston college a stuffed and mounted golden eagle that had an eight-foot-long wingspan. the stuffed bird served as the official boston college eagle from 1923 through 1961. it is pictured with john culhane, charles darling, joseph kozlowski and edward harrison (left to right) in a keystone view company of new york image. in the spring of 1961, three students (john d. provasoli, robert hart and james mclaughlin), unhappy with bc's stuffed mascot, launched \"project mascot,\" an effort to secure a live golden eagle. boston college met the governmental requirements, inoculations, and necessary housing required to keep a live eagle. the university was assisted by walter stone, superintendent of the franklin park zoo. the zoo, in fact, housed and cared for the bird. margo is pictured here. in september 1961, the eagle was named \"margo\" after a student-run name-the-eagle contest. the name was formed by combining the first letters of the boston college colors, maroon and gold. margo was brought to every home game for five seasons and to selected away games. unfortunately, in august 1966, margo was struck by aviary virus and died in the franklin park zoo. a photograph of margo with a student handler is reproduced here. stricter regulations against capturing endangered species and a greater sensitivity about a captured animal's welfare prevented boston college from again using a live mascot. instead, boston college employed a costumed human mascot. the costumed mascot acted less as a symbol and more like a supplementary cheerleader. here one of the earliest costumed mascots is pictured. the twenty-first century has brought boston college two costumed mascots named \"baldwin\" and \"baldwin jr.\" baldwin is six and a half feet tall with many bird-like features, including wings with well designed feathers. \"baldwin, jr.\" is a nine and a half foot tall mascot with inflatable features. here baldwin encourages the fans at alumni stadium. photograph courtesy media relations department, athletic association, boston college introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion \u00ab back : next \u00bb", "hrefTitle": "Mascot", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/eagle.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "United States History"], "title": "Boston College Eagle -

burns library introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion adoption of the eagle as the university mascot prior to 1920, boston college lacked a mascot. in the spring of 1920, the boston college track team won the eastern intercollegiate competitions. charlie donelan of the boston traveler illustrated the mascot-less collegiate team as a stray cat lapping up the opposition. this did not sit very well with one loyal alumnus who voiced his displeasure to the heights editorial staff. identified at the time only as \"the old man,\" the alum suggested that the lack of a school mascot led to the insulting cartoon. in his letter published in the may 14, 1920 issue, he suggested to the current student body, \"why not select - the eagle, symbolic of majesty, power, and freedom. its natural habitat is the high places. surely, the heights is made to order for such a suggestion.\" the old man was later identified as rev. edward j. mclaughlin (ex-1914). this is a portrait of mclaughlin circa 1954. in response to the old man's letter, the editor of the heights , reminded his fellow students that the cause of the insulting cartoon was not the fault of the sports cartoonist, as the student body (past and present) had never come up with a mascot. he wrote: \"the fault is ours entirely. it is important that we adopt a mascot to preside at our pow-wows and triumphant fetes.\" he urged students to write to the heights to voice their opinion of the eagle or voice an alternative for the school mascot. in the june 17th issue, the first published drawing of an eagle appeared in a corner of the special pictorial edition. the artwork was not credited but was probably the work of either robert p. walsh (1922) or j. robert brawley (1920), both members of the newspaper's art department. known as the \"college cartoonist,\" j. robert brawley (1920) claimed to have drawn the first sketch of the eagle. mclaughlin's letter was brought to the attention of the student athletic association moderated by rev. richard a. o'brien, s.j. in 1944, brawley recalled \"i was sold on the eagle idea of father mclaughlin...i went to work into that night...i grabbed a big sheet of drawing board, some water colors and went to work...when i got done, i had so much paint on it, the board must have weighed five pounds...the supplies really caught it that night. i brought the sketch into the school the next morning to father o'brien and he put it on the bulletin board with the notation that it was the proposed new mascot. it was a sketch of an eagle bearing in its talons a bc banner and soaring over a bulldog crouched in the shadow of the football. that's all i did...the eagle won. father mclaughlin [had] the idea, he presented it and it was chosen. i am grateful for the credit i have received but father mclaughlin was the creator of the eagle.\" brawley's yearbook photograph is reproduced here. there was much excitement when boston college defeated the heavily favored yale university football team in games played in 1919 and 1920. in the october 15, 1920 issue of the heights , bc athlete luke urban was pictured in a cartoon drawn by john t. sullivan. he was shown with a bald eagle perched on his shoulder, taming the yale bulldog. in the same issue, the editor noted his disappointment that the local newspaper cartoonists still represented boston college as \"a sort of flat impersonal picture of a foot-ball player bearing a neat and inoffensive tag.\" he went on that the \"university heights has the altitude, the rocks, the trees, and the general wild and free aspect which go to make up the popular conception of what an eagle's surroundings should be...we want the eagle for the boston college mascot.\" a month later, in the november 12 issue, an editorial entitled \"about that bird\" was published. the editorial goaded the college's cartoonists to feature the eagle in their efforts, as \"the work of getting the idea accepted lies almost entirely with them.\" they encouraged their readers to continue to voice their opinions. a month later, the heights art department staff member john t. sullivan (1924) drew the boldest cartoon depiction of the heights to date, showing an eagle knocking a holy cross football player from the top of gasson tower. the cartoon celebrates bc's 14-0 victory over their bitter rival and, more important, clearly depicts the eagle as the symbol of boston college. the university quickly adopted the eagle more formally into campus life. a column dedicated to sports entitled \"through the eagle's eye\" appeared for the first time in the january 20, 1921 issue of the heights. the relay team was pictured in the february 2 issue with an eagle emblem incorporated into their athletic-wear. alumnus j. robert brawley, perhaps answering the call of current students for cartoons representing the eagle, contributed two significant pieces to the 1921 sub turri yearbook. this piece celebrated that season's undefeated football team earning the eastern championship. obviously, this depiction was more fitting than the cartoon that depicted bc as a stray cat in the previous year. father mclaughlin must have been a happy man. introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion \u00ab back : next \u00bb", "hrefTitle": "Adoption", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/eagle.html"}, {"classification": ["Health Sciences", "Kinesiology and Sports"], "title": "Boston College Eagle -

burns library introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion more than a mascot: a symbol for the university in october 1954 boston college received the statue of an eagle that had been in a japanese garden on the estate of larz anderson in brookline, massachusetts. the garden was designed and planted in 1907, and a photograph in 1909 clearly shows the eagle. this happened before anderson\u2019s appointment as ambassador to japan (1912-1913). after the deaths of larz anderson and his wife isabel, many possessions of the estate were distributed to people who had worked for the andersons. they included augustus (gus) m. anderson (no relation), who had been born on the estate and had worked as a private secretary for isabel anderson for over 40 years. \u201cgus\u201d wanted to find a good place for the statue. he had displayed it outside his house but was worried about damage from hurricanes and other storms. he was a fan of boston college and knew that its mascot was the eagle. working with thomas m. herlihy, sj, pastor of st. ignatius parish, gus anderson donated the statue to the college. we are grateful to augustus anderson\u2019s daughter, betty anderson riley, and her cousin, gerry hayes, for providing much of this information. the photograph was taken by isabel anderson and published in house and garden magazine and published in 1909. mrs. riley told us about an earlier connection between isabel anderson and boston college: mrs. anderson wrote a play, \u201cdick whittington,\u201d which bc students performed enthusiastically in the 1930\u2019s. in 1957, boston college received the column and base of the admiral george dewey memorial from the city of boston. the memorial had stood in front of south station in dewey square and was taken down to make way for the central artery project. the column was placed in front of gasson hall, at the end of linden lane, and the eagle sculpture was mounted on the top. the prominent placement of the statue was clear evidence of the eagle's importance to the identity of the university. the base of the dewey memorial is crafted out of pink granite and is located in the center of the quad that is formed by lyons, gasson, devlin and fulton halls. it consists of the sculpted prows of four ships each traveling in one of four different directions. as if made deliberately for boston college, a carved eagle is on the edge of each ship's prow. a student is pictured here sitting on the base. a photograph of the eagle on the 30 foot-tall, marble pillar at the end of linden lane. in 1993, the original bronze sculpture was replaced with an exact replica. due to the harsh new england winters, the original had begun to crack and could not withstand the natural elements for much longer. the work was done by skylight studios (woburn, massachusetts), a firm that has handled restoration projects for the museum of fine arts. the firm first made cosmetic repairs to the original, then created a mold and finally cast a replica. this photograph shows tom cipolla cleaning the sculpture as he created a mold of it. like the original, the identical replica stands four feet high and has a six-foot wing span. photograph by gary gilbert, office of marketing communications today the eagle sculpture in front of gasson hall is one of the most photographed locations on boston college's campus. it has become almost a rite of passage for proud parents to take photographs of newly admitted students or graduating seniors in front of the statue, with gasson hall in the background. photograph courtesy of office of marketing communications, boston college introduction | adoption | mascot | symbol | conclusion \u00ab back : next \u00bb", "hrefTitle": "Symbol", "refURL": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/eagle.html"}, {"classification": ["Humanities", "English Language and Literature"], "title": "Free State Art: Judging Ireland by its Book Covers", "url": "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/libraries/about/exhibits-new/burnsvirtual/bkcovers/4.html", "text": "free state art: judging ireland by its book covers skip to main content boston college ever to excel free state art: judging ireland by its book covers virtual exhibit summer 2004 -
